# Anya Core Compliance Report
**Generated:** 2025-05-18 16:53:53

## Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5 Compliance

This report analyzes the Anya Core codebase for compliance with Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5
requirements and proper AI labeling standards.

## Executive Summary

### AI Labeling Compliance

- **Total Rust Files:** 230
- **Files with AI Labeling:** 45
- **Compliance Rate:** 19%

⚠️ **Compliance Warning:** AI labeling coverage is below 80% threshold.
Consider running `./scripts/enforce_ai_labels.sh --auto-fix` to automatically apply missing labels.

### BDF v2.5 Feature Compliance

| Feature | Status | Implementation Path |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Taproot (BIP-341/342) | ✅ Implemented | src/bitcoin/taproot |
| Layer 2 Protocol Support | ✅ Implemented | src/layer2, src/bitcoin/layer2 |
| DLC (Discrete Log Contracts) | ✅ Implemented | src/bitcoin/dlc |
| RSK Smart Contract Verification | ✅ Implemented | src/core/system_awareness.rs |
| Hexagonal Architecture | ✅ Implemented | src/ports, src/adapters |
| System Awareness | ✅ Implemented | src/core/system_awareness.rs |
| Monitoring Metrics | ❌ Not Found | - |

### Code Duplication Analysis

- **Bitcoin implementation directories:** 26

⚠️ **Duplication Warning:** Multiple Bitcoin implementation directories detected.
Consider running `./scripts/consolidate_bitcoin_impl.sh` to consolidate implementations.

⚠️ **Structure Warning:** Empty layer2 directory detected while implementations exist in other locations.
Consider consolidating layer2 implementations from other directories.


## Recommendations

Based on the compliance analysis, consider the following recommendations:

1. **AI Labeling**: Run `./scripts/enforce_ai_labels.sh --auto-fix` to enforce consistent AI labeling across the codebase.

2. **Code Consolidation**: Execute `./scripts/consolidate_bitcoin_impl.sh` to consolidate Bitcoin implementations into a coherent structure.

3. **Directory Structure**: Ensure a clean hexagonal architecture pattern with proper separation of ports and adapters.

4. **System Awareness**: Verify the implementation of system awareness components according to BDF v2.5.

5. **Testing**: Update test suite to validate all BDF v2.5 features.


## Conclusion

This automatic compliance report provides an overview of the current state of the Anya Core
codebase with respect to Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5 requirements and AI labeling standards.

Follow the recommendations above to address any compliance gaps and improve code quality.
