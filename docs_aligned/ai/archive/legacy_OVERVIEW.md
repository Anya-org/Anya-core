## Introduction

Anya Core's AI/ML capabilities provide advanced features for blockchain analytics, security monitoring, and system intelligence. This document provides an overview of the AI/ML components and their integration points within the Anya Core ecosystem.

## Core Components

### 1. ML System Architecture

The ML system follows a hexagonal architecture pattern with clearly defined inputs, outputs, and domain logic. Key components include:

- **Agent Checker System**: Monitors and verifies system health and readiness
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Handles data ingestion, transformation, and feature extraction
- **Model Serving**: Provides real-time inference capabilities
- **Training Framework**: Supports model training and fine-tuning

### 2. Model Types

- **Bitcoin Analytics**: Transaction pattern recognition, anomaly detection
- **Security Monitoring**: Threat detection, intrusion prevention
- **System Intelligence**: Performance optimization, resource management

### 3. Integration Points

- **Blockchain Layer**: Direct integration with Bitcoin protocol
- **API Layer**: REST and gRPC interfaces for model serving
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerting

## Key Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency inference for time-sensitive operations
- **Scalability**: Horizontal and vertical scaling support
- **Security**: Built-in security measures for AI/ML components
- **Compliance**: Adherence to regulatory requirements
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for custom models and algorithms
