# Anya DAO System [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3][DAO-3]

This directory contains the implementation of the Anya DAO system, built according to official Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) standards.

## Overview

The Anya DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) provides a governance layer for the Anya Core system, enabling decentralized decision-making and resource allocation. The DAO follows Bitcoin-style tokenomics with a fixed supply of 21 billion tokens and a halving mechanism.

## Architecture

The DAO is built using a hierarchical architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Traits**: Interface definitions for DAO functionality
- **Core**: Implementation of the core DAO functionality
- **Extensions**: Additional features and capabilities
- **Contracts**: Smart contracts for governance and tokenomics

## Key Components

### Core Components

- **DAO Core** (`core/dao-core.clar`): Implementation of core DAO functionality
- **DAO Trait** (`traits/dao-trait.clar`): Interface definition for DAO functionality
- **DEX Integration Trait** (`traits/dex-integration-trait.clar`): Interface for DEX interaction
- **Token Economics** (`extensions/token-economics.clar`): Advanced token economics implementation

### Bitcoin-Style Tokenomics

The DAO implements Bitcoin-style tokenomics with:

1. Fixed supply of 21 billion tokens
2. Halving mechanism every 210,000 blocks
3. Strategic distribution:
   - 30% to DEX for liquidity
   - 15% to development team
   - 55% to DAO/community

## Usage

The DAO provides the following functionality:

- Governance proposal creation and voting
- Treasury management
- Token distribution and management
- DEX integration and liquidity management

## Security

The DAO implementation follows strict security guidelines:

- [AIS-3] Security level 3 with comprehensive validation and threat modeling
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Timelock mechanisms for governance actions
- Extensive testing and validation

## Bitcoin Protocol Compliance

The DAO is fully compliant with Bitcoin protocols through:

- [BPC-3] Bitcoin Protocol Compliance level 3
- Integration with Bitcoin-style UTXO model
- Support for Taproot and Schnorr signatures
- Compatibility with Layer 2 solutions

## Development

To contribute to the DAO development:

1. Read the [Contributing Guide](../../dependencies/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Follow the [AI Labeling Standards](../../docs/standards/AI_LABELING.md)
3. Ensure all code meets [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)](../../docs/standards/BIP_COMPLIANCE.md) requirements

## Testing

All DAO components are tested using:

- Unit tests in `tests/dao/`
- Integration tests for cross-component functionality
- Compliance tests for Bitcoin protocol compatibility
