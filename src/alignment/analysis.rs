/// The code defines Rust structs for SystemAnalysis and AlignmentPlan, with methods to create an
/// alignment plan based on system analysis and execute it asynchronously.
/// 
/// Properties:
/// 
/// * `ml_components`: The `ml_components` field in the `SystemAnalysis` struct represents a vector of
/// MLComponent instances. These components likely contain machine learning models or algorithms used
/// within the system for various tasks such as data processing, predictions, or classifications.
/// * `active_protocols`: The `active_protocols` field in the `SystemAnalysis` struct represents a list
/// of protocols that are currently active in the system. These protocols are used for communication,
/// data exchange, or other specific functions within the system. Each element in the `active_protocols`
/// vector is of type `Protocol
/// * `system_metrics`: The `system_metrics` property in the `SystemAnalysis` struct represents the
/// metrics related to the system being analyzed. These metrics could include performance metrics,
/// resource utilization metrics, error rates, throughput, latency, etc., depending on the specific
/// context of the system being analyzed. These metrics are essential for understanding
