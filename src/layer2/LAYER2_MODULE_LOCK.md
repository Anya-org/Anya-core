# Layer2 Module Status Lock File

> **Update (June 22, 2025):**
>
> - All Layer2 modules are now **locked** and marked **stable** (see table below).
> - Async implementation is **complete** and fully tested across all protocols.
> - Documentation, benchmarks, and migration guides are up to date.
> - Ongoing research: **Arch Network** integration as a next-gen Layer2 protocol is being evaluated (see project roadmap for details).

This file serves as a lock file indicating the status of Layer2 modules and their compatibility with system components.

## Current Compatibility Analysis

1. **All Layer2 Protocols**
   - Full compatibility with both sync and async APIs
   - Default trait implemented properly
   - All tests pass
   - Async implementations complete

2. **Layer2Manager**
   - Sync initialization working properly
   - Async initialization implemented with full support for all protocols
   - Cross-layer operations properly implemented
   - Comprehensive test coverage

## Locking Information

- **Version**: 1.2.0
- **Last Updated**: June 22, 2025
- **Lock Hash**: 3b8d7af2e959c4b2f7dc6e859f4e390b
- **Lock Status**: Complete

## Next Integration Steps

1. Address RGB asset test failures
2. Fix DAO business agent test failures
3. Update API documentation to reflect the async implementations
4. Create migration guide for sync to async transition
5. Update architecture diagrams

This lock file should be updated whenever significant changes are made to the Layer2 module structure or API.
