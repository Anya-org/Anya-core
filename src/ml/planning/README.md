# ml/planning Module

Planning & Reasoning Engine

Advanced planning and reasoning capabilities for AI agents,
enabling multi-step problem solving and strategic decision making.

## Overview

The `ml/planning` module implements a sophisticated planning and reasoning engine for AI agents in the Anya Core system. This engine enables agents to create structured plans to achieve goals, reason about complex information, and make logical inferences.

## Key Components

### Planning Engine

The planning engine is responsible for:

- Goal creation and tracking
- Plan generation based on goals
- Plan execution and monitoring
- Plan refinement based on feedback

### Goal Management

The system supports structured goal representation with:

- Priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Target states with success criteria
- Resource and time constraints
- Hierarchical goal structures (parent/sub-goals)

### Planning Components

- **Planners**: Different planning algorithms (HTN, Graph Search, etc.)
- **Plans**: Structured sequences of steps with dependencies
- **Execution Tracking**: Monitoring of plan execution with logs
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of potential risks with mitigation strategies

### Reasoning Engine

The reasoning component provides:

- Logical inference using various reasoning approaches
- Consistency checking of facts and rules
- Explanation of reasoning processes
- Support for different reasoning types (deductive, inductive, etc.)

## Usage Examples

```rust
// Create a planning engine
let engine = PlanningEngine::new();

// Register a planner
engine.register_planner("htn", Arc::new(HTNPlanner::new())).await?;

// Create a goal
let goal = Goal {
    id: "task_1",
    description: "Complete task analysis",
    priority: Priority::High,
    // Additional goal details...
};
engine.create_goal(goal).await?;

// Generate a plan
let plan = engine.generate_plan("task_1", "htn", context).await?;

// Execute the plan
let execution_id = engine.execute_plan(plan).await?;
```
