## Review Stages

### Stage 1: Automated Validation

Immediate automated checks that all submissions must pass before human review.

#### Code Quality Checks

```yaml
# .anya-ci.yml configuration
validation:
  rust:
    format: true           # rustfmt compliance
    lint: true            # clippy warnings as errors
    test_coverage: 80     # minimum test coverage
    
  security:
    audit: true           # cargo audit for vulnerabilities
    ban_unsafe: false     # allow unsafe blocks with justification
    crypto_review: true   # cryptographic code validation
    
  documentation:
    api_docs: true        # rustdoc for all public APIs
    readme: true          # comprehensive README
    examples: true        # working code examples
```

#### Structure Validation

- **Directory Structure**: Compliance with extension layout standards
- **Cargo.toml**: Proper metadata and dependency management
- **License**: Valid and compatible open source license
- **Documentation**: Required documentation files present

#### Automated Test Suite

```rust
// Example automated validation tests
#[test]
fn validate_extension_structure() {
    assert!(Path::new("src/lib.rs").exists());
    assert!(Path::new("Cargo.toml").exists());
    assert!(Path::new("README.md").exists());
    assert!(Path::new("LICENSE").exists());
}

#[test]
fn validate_api_documentation() {
    let output = Command::new("cargo")
        .args(&["doc", "--no-deps"])
        .output()
        .expect("Failed to generate docs");
    
    assert!(output.status.success());
}

#[test]
fn validate_test_coverage() {
    let coverage = run_coverage_analysis();
    assert!(coverage >= 80.0, "Test coverage below 80%: {}", coverage);
}
```

### Stage 2: Security Screening

Comprehensive security analysis focusing on cryptographic implementations, key management, and vulnerability assessment.

#### Automated Security Scans

- **Dependency Audit**: Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Code analysis for common security anti-patterns
- **Cryptographic Review**: Validation of cryptographic implementations
- **Secrets Detection**: Scan for accidentally committed secrets or keys

    Medium,     // Extensions handling user data or network operations
    High,       // Extensions managing keys or financial operations
    Critical,   // Extensions with custody or significant financial impact
}

// Review requirements by security level
impl SecurityLevel {
    fn review_requirements(&self) -> ReviewRequirements {
