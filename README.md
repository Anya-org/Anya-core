# Anya: Advanced ML-Driven Decentralized Bitcoin Intelligence Platform

## Summary

Anya is a revolutionary platform designed to provide advanced Bitcoin intelligence and connectivity across all Bitcoin layers. Leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques, Anya offers unparalleled security, efficiency, and user experience while maintaining a strong focus on privacy, low fees, and sustainable growth.

## Key Features

- Autonomous ML Engine: Handles system operations and decision-making.
- Code Assimilation: Automatically scans and integrates new code and Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).
- Web5 Integration: Decentralized identity and data management.
- Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs): Supports creating and managing DLCs.
- Privacy Enhancements: CoinJoin, zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption.
- Multi-Layer Bitcoin Support: Seamless integration across all Bitcoin layers.
- DAO Governance: ML-managed proposal generation and execution.
- Developer Ecosystem: Open API, automated code review, bounty system.
- Stacks Integration: Full support for Stacks (STX).
- Lightning Network Support: Integration with the Lightning Network for fast, low-cost transactions.
- Libp2p Integration: Peer-to-peer networking capabilities.

## Technical Architecture

- Modular design with separate components.
- Decentralized node network using Kademlia DHT.
- Client-side processing for enhanced privacy.
- ML infrastructure for distributed training and privacy-preserving techniques.
- Data management with local storage and decentralized options.
- Security measures including client-side encryption, trustless verification, multi-signature schemes, and ML-driven threat detection.
- User interface with open-source development and customizable dashboards.

## Installation

1. Install Rust and Cargo:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. Install additional dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config
   ```

3. Set up the Stacks blockchain locally (follow Stacks documentation).
4. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/botshelomokoka/anya-core-main.git
   cd anya-core-main
   ```

5. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Running the Full System

To run the complete Anya Core System:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and configured correctly.
2. Start the Stacks blockchain node (if not already running).
3. Initialize the Bitcoin node:

   ```bash
   bitcoind -daemon
   ```

4. Start the Lightning Network daemon:

   ```bash
   lnd
   ```

5. Run the main Anya system:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin anya-core
   ```

6. Initialize the network discovery module:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin network_discovery
   ```

7. Start the Web5 integration:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin web5_integration
   ```

8. Launch the user management interface:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin user_management
   ```

9. For development and debugging, you can use the provided VS Code launch configurations in `.vscode/launch.json`.

## Testing

Run the complete test suite:

Run the complete test suite:

1. **Unit Tests**: To run the unit tests, use the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo test --lib
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**: To run the integration tests, use the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo test --test integration_tests
   ```

3. **Specific Test Modules**: You can also run specific test modules. For example, to run the user management tests:

   ```bash
   cargo test --test user_management_tests
   ```

4. **Continuous Integration**: Ensure that all tests pass in your CI pipeline by integrating the test commands into your CI configuration file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for GitHub Actions).
