## Development and Release Process

We follow a structured development process with multiple branches:

- `main`: The stable, production-ready branch
- `development`: The primary development branch
- Feature branches: Separate branches for each major feature or section

### Release Workflow

1. Development occurs in feature branches and is merged into the `development` branch.
2. Once a phase is complete and thoroughly tested, a release candidate branch is created.
3. After extensive testing and when deemed production-ready, the release candidate is merged into `main`.
4. A new tag is created for each release, following semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0).
