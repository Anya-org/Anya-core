   cargo build --release
   ```

## Running the Full System

To run the complete Anya Core System:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and configured correctly.
2. Start the Stacks blockchain node (if not already running).
3. Initialize the Bitcoin node:

   ```bash
   bitcoind -daemon
   ```

4. Start the Lightning Network daemon:

   ```bash
   lnd
   ```

5. Run the main Anya system:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin anya-core
   ```

6. Initialize the network discovery module:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin network_discovery
   ```

7. Start the Web5 integration:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin web5_integration
   ```

8. Launch the user management interface:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin user_management
   ```

9. For development and debugging, you can use the provided VS Code launch configurations in `.vscode/launch.json`.

## Testing

Run the complete test suite:

Run the complete test suite:

1. **Unit Tests**: To run the unit tests, use the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo test --lib
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**: To run the integration tests, use the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo test --test integration_tests
   ```

3. **Specific Test Modules**: You can also run specific test modules. For example, to run the user management tests:

   ```bash
   cargo test --test user_management_tests
   ```

4. **Continuous Integration**: Ensure that all tests pass in your CI pipeline by integrating the test commands into your CI configuration file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for GitHub Actions).
