## Current Status

- Basic project structure implemented
- User management system in place
- STX, DLC, Lightning, and Bitcoin support integrated
- Kademlia-based network discovery implemented
- Federated learning module added
- Basic CLI and testing infrastructure set up
- Modular architecture with init() functions for all core components
- Basic error handling and logging implemented
- AI ethics module with Bitcoin principles added
- Networking module placeholder created
- Test structure for core modules established

## Roadmap

We are currently working on Phase 1 of our development plan, which includes:

1. Implementing a modular, plugin-based architecture (In Progress)
2. Applying the Hexagonal Architecture pattern
3. Implementing a standardized API layer using OpenAPI 3.0
4. Developing an internal metrics and function awareness system
5. Fully implementing libp2p for P2P communications
6. Enhancing Kademlia DHT implementation
7. Integrating IPFS support

For more details on our development plan and future phases, please see the DEVPLAN.md file.

## Features (Planned)

- Decentralized user management
- Multi-blockchain support (Bitcoin, Lightning Network, Stacks, DLC)
- Federated learning with advanced ML models
- Peer-to-peer networking using libp2p
- ML models for cryptocurrency analysis and prediction
- Integration with multiple blockchain technologies

## Development and Release Process

We follow a structured development process with multiple branches:

- `main`: The stable, production-ready branch
- `development`: The primary development branch
- Feature branches: Separate branches for each major feature or section

### Release Process

1. Development occurs in feature branches and is merged into the `development` branch.
2. Once a phase is complete and thoroughly tested, a release candidate branch is created.
3. After extensive testing and when deemed production-ready, the release candidate is merged into `main`.
4. A new tag is created for each release, following semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0).

For more details on contributing and the development process, please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Running the Full System

To run the complete Anya Core System:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and configured correctly.
2. Start the Stacks blockchain node (if not already running).
3. Initialize the Bitcoin node:

   ```bash
   bitcoind -daemon
   ```

4. Start the Lightning Network daemon:

   ```bash
   lnd
   ```

5. Run the main Anya system:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin anya-core
   ```

6. Initialize the network discovery module:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin network_discovery
   ```

7. Start the Web5 integration:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin web5_integration
   ```

8. Launch the user management interface:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin user_management
   ```

9. For development and debugging, you can use the provided VS Code launch configurations in `.vscode/launch.json`.

## Testing

Run the complete test suite:

Run the complete test suite:

1. **Unit Tests**: To run the unit tests, use the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo test --lib
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**: To run the integration tests, use the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo test --test integration_tests
   ```

3. **Specific Test Modules**: You can also run specific test modules. For example, to run the user management tests:

   ```bash
   cargo test --test user_management_tests
   ```

4. **Continuous Integration**: Ensure that all tests pass in your CI pipeline by integrating the test commands into your CI configuration file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for GitHub Actions).
