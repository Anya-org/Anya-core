# Anya Core Project

Anya Core is a decentralized AI assistant framework leveraging blockchain technologies, federated learning, and advanced cryptography, with enhanced open standards support.

## Current Status

- Basic project structure implemented
- User management system in place
- STX, DLC, Lightning, and Bitcoin support integrated
- Kademlia-based network discovery implemented
- Federated learning module added
- Basic CLI and testing infrastructure set up
- Modular architecture with init() functions for all core components
- Basic error handling and logging implemented
- AI ethics module with Bitcoin principles added
- Networking module placeholder created
- Test structure for core modules established

## Roadmap

We are currently working on Phase 1 of our development plan, which includes:

1. Implementing a modular, plugin-based architecture (In Progress)
2. Applying the Hexagonal Architecture pattern
3. Implementing a standardized API layer using OpenAPI 3.0
4. Developing an internal metrics and function awareness system
5. Fully implementing libp2p for P2P communications
6. Enhancing Kademlia DHT implementation
7. Integrating IPFS support

For more details on our development plan and future phases, please see the DEVPLAN.md file.

## Features (Planned)

- Decentralized user management with DIDs and Verifiable Credentials (W3C standards)
- Multi-blockchain support (Bitcoin, Lightning Network, Stacks, IBC, Cosmos, Polkadot)
- Advanced federated learning with differential privacy (OpenFL, OpenDP)
- Peer-to-peer networking using libp2p and IPFS
- Smart contract support with Clarity and WebAssembly
- Cross-chain interoperability (IBC, Cosmos SDK, Polkadot XCMP)
- Enhanced privacy and security measures (Zero-knowledge proofs, Homomorphic encryption, Secure multi-party computation)
- Web, CLI, and mobile interfaces

## Getting Started

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Rust and Cargo
3. Run `cargo build` to build the project
4. Run `cargo run` to start the application

For development:

1. Run `cargo test` to run the test suite
2. Use `cargo doc` to generate documentation

## Development and Release Process

We follow a structured development process with multiple branches:

- `main`: The stable, production-ready branch
- `development`: The primary development branch
- Feature branches: Separate branches for each major feature or section

### Release Process

1. Development occurs in feature branches and is merged into the `development` branch.
2. Once a phase is complete and thoroughly tested, a release candidate branch is created.
3. After extensive testing and when deemed production-ready, the release candidate is merged into `main`.
4. A new tag is created for each release, following semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0).
