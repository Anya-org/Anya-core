# [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3] Implement Hexagonal Architecture for Bitcoin Module

## Bitcoin Development Framework Compliance

This PR implements a hexagonal architecture for the Bitcoin module, following the requirements specified in the Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5.

### Core Implementation Principles

- [x] Protocol Adherence (Bitcoin's core tenets of decentralization, immutability, and censorship resistance)
- [x] Privacy-Preserving Architecture (transaction indistinguishability)
- [x] Asset Management Standards (Taproot-enabled protocols)

### Technical Requirements

- [x] BIP-341 (Taproot) implementation
- [x] BIP-342 (Tapscript) implementation
- [x] Security validation for transactions
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (to be completed)

### Hexagonal Architecture Requirements

- [x] Adapter Layer
- [x] Core Logic
- [x] Protocol Adapters
- [x] Properly separated ports and adapters

## Changes Implemented

1. **Bitcoin Interface Restructuring**
   - Converted `src/bitcoin/interface.rs` into a proper directory structure
   - Added dedicated interfaces for blocks, transactions, and network operations
   - Implemented clean abstractions following hexagonal architecture principles

2. **BIP Implementation Modules**
   - Created `core/src/bip/` directory for BIP implementations
   - Added BIP-341 (Taproot) implementation
   - Added BIP-342 (Tapscript) implementation
   - Created BIP registry for implementation tracking

3. **Bitcoin Protocol Enhancement**
   - Improved SPV module with constant-time operations
   - Restructured error handling for better security
   - Enhanced module organization for better maintainability

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated SYSTEM_MAP.md with new module structure
   - Updated INDEX.md with links to new modules
   - Added architecture documentation

## Known Issues

Currently, there are compilation issues that need to be addressed:

1. Duplicate module declarations
2. AnyaError redefinition
3. Conflicting imports

These issues are documented in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bitcoin-module-compilation-issues.md` and will be resolved before this PR is merged.

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests added for BIP implementations
- [ ] Integration tests planned for SPV module
- [ ] Security validation tests for transaction handling

## Checklist

- [x] Code follows the project's coding style
- [x] Documentation has been updated
- [ ] Tests have been added/updated
- [x] Commit messages use the [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3] format
- [x] All compilation issues have been documented
