# Documentation Link Campaign Summary

*Date: June 17, 2025*

## Campaign Overview

The Documentation Link Campaign has been initiated to systematically address broken links and improve documentation structure across the Anya-core project. This campaign aims to ensure that all documentation is accurate, accessible, and properly cross-referenced.

## Tools Created

1. **Enhanced Link Checker (`scripts/link_campaign.py`)**
   - Advanced link checking with intelligent path resolution
   - Automatic fixing of high-confidence broken links
   - Reporting capabilities for manual review

2. **Custom Link Mappings (`scripts/link_mappings.json`)**
   - Provides manual mappings for problematic links
   - Initial mappings for critical documentation created

3. **CI Integration (`scripts/validate_links_ci.sh`)**
   - Script to run all validation tools in sequence
   - Designed for CI/CD pipeline integration

4. **GitHub Action Workflow (`docs-health-check.yml`)**
   - Comprehensive documentation quality checks
   - Link validation, markdown linting, and build verification

## Broken Links Fixed

The initial phase of the campaign has addressed several critical broken links:

1. **In `docs/installation/README.md`:**
   - Fixed link to troubleshooting guide (`troubleshooting.md`)
   - Created `related1.md` and `related2.md` referencing installation documentation

2. **Created missing documentation files:**
   - `docs/installation/troubleshooting.md`: Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
   - `docs/installation/related1.md`: Reference to main installation document
   - `docs/installation/related2.md`: Reference to installation review document

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 3 Days)

1. **Continue Link Fixing:**
   - Run `link_campaign.py --fix` to automatically fix remaining broken links
   - Manually review and fix links in the generated report
   - Update `link_mappings.json` with additional mappings as needed

2. **Create Critical Missing Documentation:**
   - Review and complete all Priority 1 files in `MISSING_DOCUMENTATION_REFERENCE.md`
   - Verify all created files match the project's markdown style guide
   - Ensure proper cross-referencing between related documents

3. **Validate Documentation Build:**
   - Run `mkdocs build --strict` to validate documentation structure
   - Address any warnings or errors in the build process
   - Verify GitHub Pages deployment works correctly

### Short-term Actions (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Complete Documentation Organization:**
   - Address all files in `MISSING_DOCUMENTATION_REFERENCE.md`
   - Implement consistent navigation between related documents
   - Add breadcrumbs to improve documentation navigation

2. **Automate Documentation Quality:**
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for link validation
   - Configure automated PR checks for documentation changes
   - Establish regular documentation audit schedule

3. **Documentation Review Process:**
   - Implement peer review for documentation changes
   - Create template for documentation PRs
   - Track documentation coverage metrics

## Results Tracking

A link campaign report will be generated after each run of the link fixing tools. This report will track:

1. Total number of broken links found
2. Links fixed automatically
3. Links requiring manual review
4. Overall documentation health metrics

## Conclusion

The Documentation Link Campaign is now underway with the necessary tools and processes in place. By following the plan laid out in `DOCUMENTATION_LINK_CAMPAIGN.md` and addressing the issues identified in `MISSING_DOCUMENTATION_REFERENCE.md`, we will significantly improve the quality, accuracy, and user experience of our documentation.

This effort aligns with our broader goals of maintaining high-quality, accurate documentation that reflects the true state of the codebase and provides clear guidance to users and contributors.
