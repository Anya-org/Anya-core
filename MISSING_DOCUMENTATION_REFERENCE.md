   - Action: Remove duplicate and update references

2. **contributing.md** ‚Üí **CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - Multiple versions of the same content
   - Action: Remove duplicate and update references

## Tracking Process

1. When starting work on a file, update its status to "‚è≥ In Progress"
2. When complete, update to "‚úÖ Complete" with completion date
3. Each file should be reviewed by at least one other team member
4. Run link validation after each file creation to ensure no broken links
