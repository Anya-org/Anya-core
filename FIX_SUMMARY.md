# Fix Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address code issues in the Anya-core project.

## Core Fixes

1. **Fixed AnyaError Enum**:
   - Added missing `NotFound` variant
   - Updated `fmt::Display` implementation to include the new variant
   - Added `From<serde_json::Error>` implementation for proper error handling

2. **Fixed `dao_agent.rs` Issues**:
   - Added `Clone` derive for `ParticipationMetrics` struct
   - Fixed parameter declaration in `initialize` method
   - Fixed variable naming in `predict_outcome` method (renamed `_features` to `features`)
   - Fixed move semantics by cloning values before they're moved

## Compilation Warnings

The project now builds successfully with no errors, but still has some warnings that could be addressed in future updates:

1. **Dead Code Warnings**:
   - Unused fields in various structs
   - Unused constants and methods

2. **Clippy Suggestions**:
   - Replace manual string stripping with `strip_prefix`
   - Implement `Default` trait rather than custom `default` methods
   - Fix mutex guards held across await points
   - Optimize vector initializations
   - Fix redundant borrows and references

## Next Steps

1. Address Clippy warnings using `cargo clippy --fix` where possible
2. Review and implement a plan for addressing dead code
3. Fix any remaining workflow YAML issues
4. Continue documentation link fixing campaign

## Verification

All code now successfully compiles with `cargo build`. Tests can be run with `cargo test`.
