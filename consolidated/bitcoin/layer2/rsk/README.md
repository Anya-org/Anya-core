# RSK Integration [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3]

This directory contains the RSK (Rootstock) integration for Anya Core, following official Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) standards.

## Overview

RSK is a smart contract platform with a two-way peg to Bitcoin that enables smart contracts, near-instant payments, and higher scalability while leveraging Bitcoin's security.

## Key Features

- **Two-Way Peg**: Secure bridge between Bitcoin and RSK
- **Smart Bitcoin (RBTC)**: Bitcoin-backed token on RSK
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity support for Bitcoin ecosystem
- **Federation**: Trusted federation for bridge security

## Architecture

The RSK integration follows a hexagonal architecture pattern:

- Core domain logic for RSK operations
- Adapters for Bitcoin and RSK chain interactions
- Ports for external system integration

## Implementation Details

- **Status**: ðŸ”„ 75% Complete
- **Dependencies**: Bitcoin Core, RSK Node
- **Implementation Target**: Q3 2025

## Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::layer2::rsk::RskClient;

// Create a new RSK client
let config = RskConfig::default();
let rsk_client = RskClient::new(config);

// Perform a peg-in operation
let peg_in = rsk_client.peg_in("btc_address", 0.1)?;

// Call a smart contract
let contract_call = rsk_client.call_contract("contract_address", "method", params)?;

// Get RBTC balance
let balance = rsk_client.get_rbtc_balance("address")?;
```

## Bitcoin Protocol Compliance

The RSK integration adheres to Bitcoin protocol standards:

- Securely locks BTC on Bitcoin's blockchain
- Uses SPV proofs for transaction verification
- Follows BIP standards for transaction handling
- Supports multi-signature federation verification

## Security

RSK operations are secured through:

- Federated multi-signature security model
- SPV proofs for transaction verification
- Merkle path verification for block inclusion
- Advanced monitoring for bridge operations
