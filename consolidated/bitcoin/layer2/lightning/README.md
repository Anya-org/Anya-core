# Lightning Network Implementation [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3]

This directory contains the Lightning Network implementation for Anya Core, following official Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) standards.

## Overview

Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol enabling fast, low-cost transactions through payment channels, significantly improving Bitcoin's scalability and transaction throughput.

## Key Features

- **Payment Channels**: Fast and low-fee off-chain transactions
- **Multi-hop Routing**: Payment routing across the network
- **HTLC Support**: Hash Time Locked Contracts for secure payments
- **Watchtowers**: Protection against channel breaches

## Architecture

The Lightning implementation follows a hexagonal architecture pattern:

- Core domain logic for channel operations
- Adapters for Bitcoin transaction and peer interactions
- Ports for external system integration

## Implementation Details

- **Status**: ðŸ”„ 75% Complete
- **Dependencies**: Bitcoin Core, Lightning Network Daemon (LND) or Lightning Development Kit (LDK)
- **Implementation Target**: Q2 2025

## Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::layer2::lightning::LightningClient;

// Create a new Lightning client
let config = LightningConfig::default();
let lightning_client = LightningClient::new(config);

// Connect to a peer
lightning_client.connect_peer("node_pub_key", "127.0.0.1", 9735)?;

// Open a channel
let channel = lightning_client.open_channel("node_pub_key", 100_000, None, false)?;

// Create an invoice
let invoice = lightning_client.create_invoice(50_000, "Test payment", 3600)?;

// Pay an invoice
let payment = lightning_client.pay_invoice(&invoice.bolt11, None)?;
```

## Bitcoin Protocol Compliance

The Lightning implementation adheres to Bitcoin protocol standards:

- Uses Bitcoin transactions for channel funding and settlement
- Implements BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) specifications
- Supports Taproot for enhanced privacy
- Follows BIP standards for transaction handling

## Security

Lightning operations are secured through:

- Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs) for transaction safety
- Watchtower support for channel monitoring
- Onion routing for payment privacy
- Proper channel backup and recovery mechanisms
