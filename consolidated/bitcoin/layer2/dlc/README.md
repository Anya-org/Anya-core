# Discreet Log Contracts [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3]

This directory contains the Discreet Log Contracts (DLC) implementation for Anya Core, following official Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) standards.

## Overview

DLCs are a type of smart contract that use signatures from oracles to determine contract outcomes, enabling conditional payment use cases on Bitcoin with enhanced privacy.

## Key Features

- **Contract Lifecycle**: Offer, accept, sign, execute
- **Oracle Integration**: Use oracle signatures for outcomes
- **Event Management**: Handle events and their outcomes
- **Privacy Preservation**: Keep contracts private

## Architecture

The DLC implementation follows a hexagonal architecture pattern:

- Core domain logic for contract operations
- Adapters for Bitcoin transaction and oracle interactions
- Ports for external system integration

## Implementation Details

- **Status**: ðŸ”„ 75% Complete
- **Dependencies**: Bitcoin Core, Oracle Systems
- **Implementation Target**: Q3 2025

## Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::layer2::dlc::DlcClient;

// Create a new DLC client
let config = DlcConfig::default();
let dlc_client = DlcClient::new(config);

// Create a contract offer
let offer = dlc_client.create_offer(
    collateral_amount,
    outcome_values,
    oracle_info,
    expiry_time,
)?;

// Accept a contract offer
let accepted = dlc_client.accept_offer(offer_id, collateral_amount)?;

// Sign a contract
let signed = dlc_client.sign_contract(contract_id)?;

// Execute a contract with oracle attestation
let execution = dlc_client.execute_contract(contract_id, oracle_signature)?;
```

## Bitcoin Protocol Compliance

The DLC implementation adheres to Bitcoin protocol standards:

- Uses Bitcoin transactions for contract execution
- Supports Schnorr signatures for oracle attestations
- Leverages adaptor signatures for privacy
- Follows BIP-340/341/342 standards for signatures and script validation

## Security

DLC execution is secured through:

- Cryptographic verification of oracle signatures
- Timelock mechanisms for contract execution windows
- Multi-signature contract protection
- Adaptor signature privacy
