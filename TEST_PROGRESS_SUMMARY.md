# Test Organization Progress Summary

## Overall Progress

We've made substantial progress in organizing and fixing the test suite according to logical components:

1. **Created compatibility shims** to facilitate test migration without major code rewrites
2. **Fixed module visibility issues** to allow proper importing of test functions
3. **Updated test APIs** to be compatible with Bitcoin v0.32.6
4. **Added missing dependencies** for specialized tests (DAO, Lightning)
5. **Restructured benchmarks** to work on stable Rust

## Approach Taken

We took a modular approach that minimizes changes to existing test code:

1. **Created compatibility modules** that provide shims for old import structures
2. **Fixed visible type signatures** rather than refactoring test code
3. **Added missing dependencies** with correct version specifications
4. **Improved documentation** of test structure and organization

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Next Steps |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Bitcoin Core | 70% Complete | Fix remaining imports and API usage |
| Layer2 Tests | 40% Complete | Complete shims and fix mock implementations |
| DAO Tests | 60% Complete | Fix contract references and test environment |
| Integration Tests | 50% Complete | Complete shims and cross-module dependencies |
| Lightning Tests | 20% Complete | Add remaining dependencies and fix imports |
| Test Utilities | 30% Complete | Consolidate and clean up unused code |

## Remaining Issues

1. **Import Structure**: While we've created compatibility shims, some imports still need to be fixed to point to the correct modules.

2. **API Compatibility**: The Bitcoin v0.32.6 API has differences that require updates in several test files, particularly around:
   - TweakedPublicKey API
   - ControlBlock structure
   - Script execution

3. **Missing Test Fixtures**: Some tests reference contract files that may not exist or are in different locations.

4. **Duplicate Test Utilities**: There is significant duplication in test utilities that should be consolidated.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Bitcoin Tests**: Finish fixing all Bitcoin-related test imports and APIs

2. **Layer2 Implementation**: Complete the Layer2 protocol compatibility shims

3. **Integration Test Fixes**: Complete integration test compatibility

4. **Clean Up Unused Code**: Mark or remove dead test code

5. **Consolidate Test Utilities**: Move common utilities to a central location

6. **Document Test Structure**: Create a comprehensive test organization guide

## Conclusion

The test organization is progressing well. By using compatibility shims, we've minimized the need for extensive rewrites while still moving toward a more organized test structure. Once complete, the tests will be logically organized, follow a consistent structure, and work with the current API versions.
