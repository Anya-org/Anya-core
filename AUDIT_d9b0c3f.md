# Audit Report for Commit d9b0c3f

**Commit:** `d9b0c3f`
**Author:** (Unknown)
**Date:** (Unknown)
**Summary:** `refactor: replace global system state with instance-based access pattern`

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This commit introduces a valuable and necessary architectural refactoring by eliminating global system state. However, the implementation is critically flawed, as it **disables the core compliance and security analysis engine** by replacing functional code with non-operational stubs. 

**This is a release-blocking issue.** The architectural improvement must be preserved, but the functionality must be fully restored before this can be included in a release.

## 2. Architectural Analysis (Approved)

The removal of the global `SYSTEM_STATE` and `AGENT_REGISTRY` in favor of instance-based `Arc<Manager>` dependency injection is a significant step forward. 

- **Alignment:** Fully aligns with Hexagonal Architecture principles.
- **Benefits:** Improves testability, reduces coupling, and enhances system stability.
- **Verdict:** The architectural pattern is approved and should be the standard going forward.

## 3. Implementation Analysis (Rejected)

The implementation in `src/ml/agents/system_map.rs` is unacceptable. To resolve compilation errors, the developer introduced numerous stub functions, effectively gutting the `analyze_rust_file` function.

### Critical Defects:

- **Disabled Code Parsing:** The use of `syn::parse_file` was replaced with a stub, meaning the system no longer produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for analysis.
- **Disabled Metrics:** All metrics derived from the AST (e.g., `cyclomatic_complexity`, `unsafe_usage_count`) are now hardcoded to `0`.
- **Disabled Security & Compliance Checks:** Functions like `check_bitcoin_security` and `calculate_protocol_adherence` have been stubbed out and return default, non-representative values.

**The system has lost its ability to self-audit. This is a critical regression.**

## 4. Required Remediation (Urgent)

The following actions must be taken to resolve this issue:

1.  **Preserve the Architecture:** The instance-based manager pattern (`Arc<SystemMapManager>`, etc.) must be kept.
2.  **Remove All Stub Functions:** All functions commented as `// Stub` or `// Stub implementation` in `system_map.rs` must be removed.
3.  **Restore Analysis Logic:** The `analyze_rust_file` function must be correctly re-implemented to:
    -   Properly parse Rust code using the `syn` crate.
    -   Calculate and report accurate metrics for cyclomatic complexity, unsafe blocks, test coverage, etc.
    -   Correctly call the real implementations for dependency analysis, Clippy lints, and Bitcoin security checks.
4.  **Ensure No Regressions:** The restored functionality must be tested to confirm it is operating at or above the level it was before this commit.

This work is the highest priority for the `release/0.3.0` cycle. No release can proceed until this is fixed.
