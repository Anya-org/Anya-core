## 🚨 STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIREMENTS - NON-NEGOTIABLE

### **ALL FUTURE WORK REJECTED WITHOUT COMPLIANCE**

**COMMIT RULES ENFORCEMENT**:
```
feat(ci): implement evidence-based workflow consolidation  

Consolidate 18 workflows into 4 streamlined, verification-enforced workflows
- Add unimplemented!() threshold checking (>100 = CI failure)
- Implement verification script integration
- Add release gates requiring 0 unimplemented!() functions

Labels: [AIR-3][AIS-3][AIT-3][CI-2][PFM-2][SCL-2][RES-2]
Verification: Workflow count reduced from 18 to 4, all CI checks passing
```

**BRANCH STRATEGY MANDATORY**:
- ✅ Feature branches: All work via feature/fix branches
- ✅ Pull requests: Required with maintainer review
- ✅ CI validation: All workflows must pass before merge
- ❌ Direct main pushes: Automatically rejected

**LABELING REQUIREMENTS**:
- **CI/CD Components**: Must include AIR, AIS, AIT, CI, PFM, SCL, RES
- **Documentation**: Must include AIR, DOC
- **Security**: Must include AIR, AIS, AIT, SEC
- **Performance**: Must include PFM, SCL where applicable

## 🎯 COMPLETED WORK SUMMARY

### 1. Git Workflows Consolidation ✅ COMPLETED

**BEFORE**: 18+ workflow files with excessive complexity and redundancy
**AFTER**: 4 streamlined, evidence-enforced workflows

#### New Workflow Structure

1. **`ci-main.yml`** - Evidence-based CI with verification script integration
   - Unimplemented!() threshold enforcement (>100 = failure)
   - Comprehensive build, test, clippy, documentation validation
   - Verification artifact upload for tracking

2. **`security.yml`** - Security audit and code quality
   - Weekly automated security scanning
   - License compliance checking  
   - Unsafe code analysis
   - Secret scanning with gitleaks

3. **`docs.yml`** - Documentation evidence validation
   - Aspirational claims detection ("100% complete", "fully implemented")
   - Implementation claims vs. reality verification
   - Link checking and markdown linting
   - Documentation structure validation

4. **`release.yml`** - Enhanced release with strict gates
   - Zero unimplemented!() functions required for release
   - Pre-release verification script execution
   - Automated version management

#### Removed Redundant Files

- ❌ `comprehensive-ci.yml` (duplicated ci.yml functionality)
- ❌ `docs-link-check.yml`, `docs-validate.yml`, `docs-health-check.yml` (consolidated into docs.yml)
- ❌ `branch-name-validator.yml`, `branch-protection.yml` (unnecessary complexity)
- ❌ `testnet-to-mainnet.yml` (247 lines - replace with evidence-based approach)

### 2. DWN Storage Architecture Guide ✅ COMPLETED

**Created**: `DWN_STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive production implementation guide

#### Current DWN Status (Evidence-Based)

```rust
// VERIFIED WORKING (592 lines of code in /src/web5/dwn.rs)
✅ DWN Core Functions: store_record, query_records, send_message implemented
✅ Cross-Platform Support: Rust and Dart implementations functional
✅ Configuration: DWNConfig, DWNMessage, DWNRecord data structures
❌ Production Backend: Currently HashMap-based (needs SQLite/IPFS)
❌ Encryption: Not implemented (production requirement)
❌ Network Sync: Not implemented (production requirement)
```

#### Production Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Replace HashMap with SQLite/IPFS backend
2. **Phase 2**: Implement ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption
3. **Phase 3**: Add network synchronization and IPFS integration
4. **Integration**: RGB asset storage via DWN, Bitcoin anchoring

#### Performance & Security Specifications

- **Cache hit rate**: >90% (5-minute TTL implemented)
- **Batch operations**: 50 records per batch (implemented)
- **Query response**: <100ms target for cached data
- **Encryption**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES-256-GCM required
- **HSM Integration**: Leverage existing HSM framework for keys

### 3. Documentation Updates ✅ COMPLETED

#### Updated Core Documents

1. **`IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_VERIFIED_REALITY.md`**
   - Added git workflow consolidation status
   - Added DWN storage architecture summary
   - Updated with evidence-based verification (62 unimplemented!() macros)

2. **`PRD_PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTATION_AI_PROMPT.md`**
   - Added evidence-based enforcement requirements
   - Added DWN storage implementation specifications
   - Added workflow consolidation architecture
   - Updated with verification script integration requirements

3. **`GIT_WORKFLOWS_ANALYSIS.md`**
   - Documented 18→4 workflow consolidation analysis
   - Provided evidence-based workflow recommendations
   - Documented problem analysis and solution approach

### 4. Evidence-Based Enforcement ✅ COMPLETED

#### Verification Script Integration

```yaml
# All workflows now enforce reality
- name: Enforce Reality Check
  run: |
    UNIMPL_COUNT=$(grep -r "unimplemented!" --include="*.rs" . | wc -l)
    if [ "$UNIMPL_COUNT" -gt 100 ]; then
      echo "❌ Too many unimplemented functions: $UNIMPL_COUNT"
      exit 1
    fi
```

#### Documentation Validation

```yaml
# Block aspirational claims
- name: Verify Evidence-Based Claims
  run: |
    if grep -r "100% complete" . --exclude-dir=target --exclude-dir=.git; then
      echo "❌ Found aspirational claims without evidence"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## 📊 CURRENT VERIFIED STATUS

**Verification Script Output (July 5, 2025 12:39 PM):**

```bash
✅ Compilation: PASSING
❌ 62 unimplemented!() macros remaining (down from 73 - RGB progress!)
❌ 18 todo!() stubs remaining  
❌ 15 SQLite TODOs remaining
❌ 141 mock implementations detected
❌ 64 compilation warnings

📊 OVERALL: NOT PRODUCTION READY (62 unimplemented!() functions)
🎯 PRIORITY: Complete DLC protocol unimplemented!() functions
```

## 🚀 NEXT ACTIONS

### Immediate Priority (Phase 1)

1. **Complete DLC Protocol** - Replace 21+ unimplemented!() functions in `/anya-bitcoin/layer2/dlc/`
2. **Lightning Network** - Complete payment channel implementations
3. **Web5/DID Integration** - Replace 18 todo!() stubs

### Medium Term (Phase 2)

1. **DWN Production Backend** - Replace HashMap with SQLite/IPFS
2. **Storage Encryption** - Implement ChaCha20-Poly1305 
3. **Mock Replacement** - Replace 141 mock implementations

### Quality Gates (Release Requirements)

- [ ] **unimplemented!() = 0** (currently 62)
- [ ] **todo!() = 0** (currently 18)  
- [ ] **SQLite TODOs = 0** (currently 15)
- [ ] **Mock implementations < 10** (currently 141)
- [ ] **Warnings < 10** (currently 64)

## 🔗 KEY DOCUMENTS CREATED/UPDATED

1. `GIT_WORKFLOWS_ANALYSIS.md` - Workflow consolidation analysis
2. `DWN_STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` - Production DWN implementation guide
3. `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_VERIFIED_REALITY.md` - Updated with consolidation status
4. `PRD_PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTATION_AI_PROMPT.md` - Updated with evidence enforcement

## ⚖️ ENFORCEMENT SUMMARY

**ALL FUTURE WORK MUST:**

- Pass verification script (`./scripts/verify_implementation_status.sh`)
- Include evidence commands in documentation
- Reduce unimplemented!() macro count (target: 0)
- Follow evidence-based approach (no aspirational claims)
- Use the 4 consolidated workflows for CI/CD

**BRANCH STATUS**: Ready for review and merge to main with evidence-based implementation approach now enforced.
