# Anya Core 1.0.0-rc1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 28/03/2025
**BDF Compliance:** v2.5
**Status:** Release Candidate

## Overview

Anya Core 1.0.0-rc1 represents a significant milestone in our journey to provide a fully compliant Bitcoin Development Framework implementation. This release candidate implements all requirements specified in BDF v2.5, with particular focus on security, reliability, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Major Components

### 1. Hardware Security Module Fallback Testing

The `HardwareFallbackTest` module provides comprehensive detection and graceful degradation for hardware security components:

- Automatic detection of HSM, SGX, FPGA, and TPM security devices
- Software-based fallback implementations when hardware is unavailable
- Runtime switching between implementations based on security requirements
- Complete test suite for validation of secure operation

### 2. Atomic Database Installation with State Rollback

The `DatabaseStateManager` implements a robust system for managing database state during installation:

- Transaction-based phase tracking for atomic installation
- Snapshot creation at critical installation points
- Rollback capabilities to previous known-good states
- Integration with PostgreSQL for reliable state persistence

### 3. Enhanced Windows Platform Support

The `WindowsInstaller` provides Windows-specific integration points:

- Windows Service registration and lifecycle management
- Registry key management and configuration
- Windows Firewall rule configuration
- Event Log integration for audit compliance
- PowerShell-based installation script with elevated privileges

### 4. Validator Address Rotation Mechanism

The `ValidatorRotationManager` implements a comprehensive key rotation system:

- Support for multiple address types (Legacy, SegWit, Native SegWit, Taproot)
- Multi-signature configuration management
- Automatic signature threshold adjustment
- Hardware Security Module integration
- Secure key generation and rotation scheduling

### 5. CPU-Specific Cryptographic Optimizations

The `CryptoOptimizer` framework provides performance enhancements through CPU-specific optimizations:

- Runtime detection of AVX, AVX2, SSE4, and SHA instruction set extensions
- Optimized implementations for common cryptographic operations
- Automatic fallback to generic implementations on unsupported hardware
- Comprehensive benchmarking capabilities for performance verification

## BDF v2.5 Compliance

This release candidate achieves full compliance with Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5 specifications:

### Protocol Adherence
- ✅ Maintains Bitcoin's core tenets of decentralization, immutability, and censorship resistance
- ✅ Implements verification mechanisms for Bitcoin-backed transactions
- ✅ Supports Taproot (BIP-341) for enhanced privacy and scalability

### Privacy-Preserving Architecture
- ✅ Implements Discrete Log Contracts (DLCs) using non-interactive oracle patterns
- ✅ Supports Schnorr-based signatures for transaction indistinguishability
- ✅ Provides 2-of-2 MuSig implementation for multi-signature transactions

### Asset Management Standards
- ✅ Integrates with Taproot-enabled protocols for asset issuance
- ✅ Implements RGB protocol compatibility layer for Taproot Assets
- ✅ Supports JSON metadata for asset configuration

## BIP Support Status

| BIP | Implementation | Test Coverage | Audit Status |
|------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| 341 (Taproot) | Full | 100% | Verified |
| 342 (Taproot Scripts) | Full | 98% | Pending |
| 174 (PSBT) | Full | 100% | Verified |
| 370 (Tapscript) | Partial | 85% | In Progress |

## Testing Information

All components have undergone comprehensive testing according to BDF v2.5 requirements:

- **Unit Tests**: 100% coverage for consensus-critical code
- **Integration Tests**: Testnet simulations with multiple node types
- **Security Testing**: Initial fuzzing completed (5M iterations)
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verified on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms

## Known Issues

- BIP-370 implementation requires additional test coverage (currently at 85%)
- Final CertiK audit remediation pending
- Some CPU-specific optimizations may require additional performance tuning

## Upcoming Work

Before final release, the following items will be addressed:

- Complete BIP-370 test coverage to 100%
- Address any findings from the final CertiK security audit
- Complete fuzz testing to 10M+ iterations
- Finalize documentation for all new components

## Installation

The installation process has been streamlined across all supported platforms:

- **Linux**: `./scripts/install.sh`
- **macOS**: `./scripts/install.sh`
- **Windows**: `.\scripts\Install-AnyaCore.ps1`

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the Bitcoin development community, CertiK security researchers, and all contributors who helped make this release possible.
