# Hardware Acceleration Security

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for the hardware acceleration features implemented in Anya Bitcoin.

## Overview

Hardware acceleration significantly improves performance for cryptographic operations, particularly for Taproot and batch verification. This document focuses on maintaining security while leveraging performance benefits.

## Supported Hardware Acceleration

### 1. CPU Vectorization

- AVX2/AVX512 instruction sets
- SIMD operations for batch signature verification
- Specialized cryptographic instruction sets (AES-NI, SHA-NI)

### 2. GPU Acceleration

- CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs
- OpenCL for cross-platform support
- Batch operations for signature verification and hash computations

### 3. Neural Processing Units (NPUs)

- AI accelerator optimizations for pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection in transaction patterns
- Hardware-accelerated validation of complex scripts

## Security Considerations

### 1. Side-Channel Attack Prevention

Side-channel attacks exploit hardware-level information leakage (timing, power consumption, electromagnetic emissions) to extract sensitive data.

#### Mitigations

- Constant-time operations for sensitive cryptographic functions
- Blinding techniques for private key operations
- Secure memory management with protections against cold boot attacks
- Hardware-level countermeasures against power analysis

```rust
// Example of time-constant comparison with hardware acceleration
fn secure_compare(a: &[u8], b: &[u8]) -> bool {
    if a.len() != b.len() {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Use hardware acceleration if available with constant-time guarantees
    if hardware_support::has_secure_compare() {
        return hardware_support::secure_compare(a, b);
    }
    
    // Software fallback with constant-time comparison
    let mut result = 0u8;
    for (x, y) in a.iter().zip(b.iter()) {
        result |= x ^ y;
    }
    
    result == 0
}
```

### 2. Hardware Acceleration Fallbacks

#### Security Issues

- Hardware implementations may contain bugs or vulnerabilities
- Different hardware may produce inconsistent results
- Hardware availability varies across environments

#### Mitigations

- Always implement secure software fallbacks
- Validate hardware results against software implementations for critical operations
- Comprehensive testing across different hardware configurations
- Version detection for hardware-specific vulnerabilities

### 3. Memory Management

#### Security Issues

- GPU memory is not automatically cleared after computation
- Shared memory environments in cloud deployments
- DMA attacks on physical hardware

#### Mitigations

- Explicit memory sanitization after sensitive operations
- Encryption of data transferred to acceleration hardware
- Memory isolation techniques for sensitive operations
- Prevention of swap file usage for sensitive data

## Implementation Security Guidelines

### 1. Batch Operations Security

```rust
// Example of secure batch verification
fn verify_batch_signatures(
    keys: &[XOnlyPublicKey],
    messages: &[&[u8]],
    signatures: &[SchnorrSignature],
) -> Result<bool, Error> {
    // Input validation
    if keys.len() != messages.len() || keys.len() != signatures.len() {
        return Err(Error::InvalidInput("Mismatched batch verification inputs"));
    }
    
    // Use hardware acceleration when available
    if hardware_support::has_batch_verification() {
        let hw_result = hardware_support::verify_batch(keys, messages, signatures);
        
        // Validate a random subset against software implementation (defense in depth)
        if hw_result && security_level == SecurityLevel::Critical {
            validate_random_subset(keys, messages, signatures)?;
        }
        
        return Ok(hw_result);
    }
    
    // Software fallback
    software_batch_verification(keys, messages, signatures)
}
```

### 2. Cryptographic Hardware Validation

- Verify correct behavior with test vectors
- Implement cryptographic integrity checks for hardware operations
- Employ runtime verification techniques
- Use differential fuzzing to detect inconsistencies

### 3. Error Handling

- Secure failure modes for hardware acceleration errors
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Fallback mechanisms for hardware failures
- Monitoring and alerting for hardware anomalies

## Threat Model for Hardware Acceleration

### Primary Threats

1. **Hardware Backdoors**
   - Mitigation: Validation against known-good software implementations
   - Periodic security audits of hardware implementations

2. **Side-Channel Information Leakage**
   - Mitigation: Side-channel resistant implementations
   - Regular testing with power analysis tools

3. **Inconsistent Results**
   - Mitigation: Verification of critical results
   - Robust error handling with secure fallbacks

4. **Hardware Availability Attacks**
   - Mitigation: Graceful degradation to software implementations
   - Resource limiting to prevent exhaustion attacks

## Performance vs. Security Tradeoffs

### Security-Critical Operations

For security-critical operations (e.g., signing with high-value keys):

- Always prioritize security over performance
- Use hardware acceleration only after thorough validation
- Consider hardware security modules (HSMs) instead of general-purpose accelerators

### Performance-Critical Operations

For performance-critical operations (e.g., batch verification of signatures):

- Use hardware acceleration with appropriate safeguards
- Implement periodic validation of hardware results
- Balance security checks with performance considerations

## Testing Requirements

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Test vectors for all cryptographic operations
   - Cross-implementation verification

2. **Security Testing**
   - Side-channel analysis
   - Differential fuzzing
   - Incorrect input handling

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing under various conditions
   - Resource consumption monitoring
   - Fallback performance measurement
