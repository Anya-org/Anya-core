## Memory and CPU Usage

The following charts show memory and CPU usage under load:

### Memory Usage Over Time

As expected, the async implementation uses slightly more memory due to the overhead of the async runtime and task management. However, the increase is acceptable given the performance benefits.

### CPU Usage Under Load

Interestingly, the async implementation generally shows lower CPU usage despite higher throughput. This is due to more efficient I/O handling and reduced context switching.

## Conclusion

The async Layer2 protocol implementation provides substantial performance benefits across all tested protocols and operations. The most significant improvements are seen in:

1. **High Concurrency Scenarios**: Async implementation scales much better with increasing concurrency
2. **I/O-Bound Operations**: Network operations show the greatest improvement
3. **Cross-Layer Operations**: Complex operations involving multiple protocols benefit greatly

While there is a small memory overhead, the benefits in terms of throughput, latency reduction, and CPU efficiency make the async implementation clearly superior for production use cases.

## Recommendations

Based on the benchmark results, we recommend:

1. **Use async for all new Layer2 protocol implementations**
2. **Consider migrating existing sync implementations to async**
3. **Configure appropriate thread pools for optimal performance**
4. **Implement proper timeouts and circuit breakers for production use**
5. **Monitor memory usage in high-concurrency environments**
