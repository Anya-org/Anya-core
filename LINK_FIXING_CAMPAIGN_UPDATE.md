# Link Fixing Campaign Update

*Date: June 17, 2025*

## Progress Summary

We've made significant progress in establishing the necessary tools and processes for the documentation link fixing campaign. This document summarizes what has been accomplished and outlines the next steps.

### Tools Created

1. **Advanced Link Campaign Script (`scripts/link_campaign.py`)**
   - Identifies broken links across all documentation
   - Can automatically fix links where high-confidence matches are found
   - Generates detailed reports of broken links

2. **Simplified Link Campaign Script (`scripts/simple_link_campaign.py`)**
   - More robust implementation focusing on reliability
   - Found 528 broken links in the codebase
   - Generated a comprehensive report of issues

3. **Critical Link Fixer (`scripts/fix_critical_links.py`)**
   - Targeted approach for fixing the most important documentation links
   - Uses predefined mappings for critical documentation files
   - Successfully fixed key links in installation documentation

4. **Custom Link Mappings (`scripts/link_mappings.json`)**
   - Provides manual mappings for problematic links
   - Currently contains mappings for key installation documentation

5. **CI Integration (`scripts/validate_links_ci.sh`)**
   - Combines all validation tools for CI/CD integration
   - Can be run as part of automated testing

6. **GitHub Actions Workflow (`docs-health-check.yml`)**
   - Integrates link checking into the CI/CD pipeline
   - Performs markdown linting and documentation building

### Fixed Documentation Issues

1. **Missing Critical Files Created:**
   - `/docs/installation/troubleshooting.md`: Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
   - `/docs/installation/related1.md`: Reference to main installation document
   - `/docs/installation/related2.md`: Reference to installation review document

2. **Documentation Campaign Planning:**
   - `DOCUMENTATION_LINK_CAMPAIGN.md`: Detailed plan and methodology
   - `MISSING_DOCUMENTATION_REFERENCE.md`: Tracking of missing files
   - `DOCUMENTATION_LINK_CAMPAIGN_SUMMARY.md`: Campaign progress overview

### PR Template Created

Added a PR template specifically for documentation changes at:

- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/documentation.md`

## Current Status

1. **Link Analysis Complete:**
   - 604 markdown files analyzed
   - 528 broken links identified
   - Link report generated at `link_campaign_report.md`

2. **Critical Paths Fixed:**
   - Installation documentation links updated
   - Links in key system files corrected

3. **Automation Ready:**
   - Tools in place for ongoing link maintenance
   - CI integration ready for implementation

## Technical Challenges

During the implementation of the link fixing campaign, we encountered several technical challenges:

1. **Path Resolution Complexity:**
   - Calculating relative paths between files was more complex than expected
   - Fixed by implementing better path normalization and error handling

2. **Scale of the Problem:**
   - With 528 broken links, manual fixing is impractical
   - Prioritized the most critical documentation paths

3. **Custom Link Mappings:**
   - Some links need manual mapping as automatic detection is insufficient
   - Implemented a JSON-based mapping system for custom resolutions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Days)

1. **Complete High-Priority Link Fixes:**
   - Fix remaining links in installation documentation
   - Ensure all links in system map documentation work correctly

2. **Refine Automatic Fixing:**
   - Improve the automatic link fixing logic
   - Add more custom mappings for common cases

3. **Implement CI Checks:**
   - Integrate link checking into pre-commit hooks
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflow to run on PRs

### Short-term Actions (1 Week)

1. **Fix All Critical Areas:**
   - Fix links in API documentation
   - Fix links in Bitcoin protocol documentation
   - Fix links in Layer2 protocol documentation

2. **Create Missing Documentation:**
   - Complete all Priority 1 & 2 files in `MISSING_DOCUMENTATION_REFERENCE.md`
   - Ensure proper cross-referencing between documents

3. **Documentation Build Process:**
   - Ensure mkdocs builds successfully
   - Configure automated GitHub Pages deployment

### Long-term Strategy (Ongoing)

1. **Regular Link Audits:**
   - Schedule weekly link validation
   - Monitor and fix new broken links proactively

2. **Documentation Guidelines:**
   - Enforce link standards in new documentation
   - Train team members on proper documentation practices

## Conclusion

The link fixing campaign has successfully established the infrastructure needed to address the documentation issues in the Anya-core project. While the scale of the problem (528 broken links) is significant, we now have the tools and processes in place to systematically fix these issues.

By focusing first on critical documentation paths and then expanding to cover all areas, we'll ensure that the documentation becomes a reliable, accessible resource that accurately reflects the codebase.
