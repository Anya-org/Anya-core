It explains the causes of these errors and provides practical advice on how to resolve them. Table of Contents \u00b6 Dependency Errors Version Mismatches Build Script Failures Missing Dependencies Feature Flag Errors Conflicting Features Missing Features Workspace Errors Inconsistent Dependencies Path Issues Other Common Errors Linker Errors Permission Errors Debugging Common Cargo Errors \u00b6 This section provides a step-by-step guide to debugging common Cargo errors. Step 1: Read the Error Message \u00b6 The first step in debugging any Cargo error is to carefully read the error message. The error message will often give you a clue as to what is causing the problem. For example, if you see an error message that says \"unresolved import\", it means that the compiler was unable to find a crate that is referenced in your code. Step 2: Check the Documentation \u00b6 If you are not sure what the error message means, you can check the documentation for the crate that is causing the problem. The documentation will often provide more information about the error and how to fix it. Step 3: Search for the Error Online \u00b6 If you are still not sure how to fix the error, you can search for the error online. There is a good chance that someone else has had the same problem and has found a solution. Step 4: Ask for Help \u00b6 If you have tried all of the above and you are still having problems, you can ask for help on the Rust forums or on the Rust Discord server. There are many helpful people in the Rust community who are willing to help you with your problem. Practical Examples \u00b6 Here are a few practical examples of how to debug common Cargo errors: Error: unresolved import This error occurs when the compiler is unable to find a crate that is referenced in your code. To fix this error, you will need to add the crate to your Cargo.toml file. Error: cannot find function This error occurs when the compiler is unable to find a function that is referenced in your code. To fix this error, you will need to make sure that the function is defined in the current scope. Error: mismatched types This error occurs when the compiler finds two different types that are not compatible with each other. To fix this error, you will need to make sure that the types are compatible. Additional Resources \u00b6 The Cargo Book The Rust Programming Language Rust by Example Dependency Errors \u00b6 Dependency errors are some of the most common errors that you will encounter when working with Cargo. These errors occur when there is a problem with one of the dependencies in your project. Version Mismatches \u00b6 Version mismatches occur when two or more of your dependencies require different versions of the same crate. This can happen when you are using a dependency that has not been updated in a while, or when you are using a dependency that is not compatible with the other dependencies in your project. How to Fix: Update your dependencies: The first step is to try updating your dependencies to the latest versions. You can do this by running cargo update . Use a version specifier: If updating your dependencies does not work, you can try using a version specifier to force Cargo to use a specific version of the crate. For example, you can use the = operator to specify an exact version, or the ~ operator to specify a compatible version. Use a patch section: If you are still having problems, you can use a [patch] section in your Cargo.toml file to override the version of a dependency. This is a powerful feature, but it should be used with caution as it can lead to other problems. Build Script Failures \u00b6 Build script failures occur when a dependency's build script fails to execute. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a missing dependency, a problem with the build environment, or a bug in the build script itself. How to Fix: Check the build script's output: The first step is to check the build script's output for any error messages. This will often give you a clue as to what is causing the problem. Install any missing dependencies: If the build script is failing because of a missing dependency, you will need to install it. You can do this by using your system's package manager, or by installing the dependency from source. Check your build environment: If the build script is failing because of a problem with your build environment, you will need to fix it. This may involve setting an environment variable, or installing a missing tool. Report the bug: If you have tried all of the above and you are still having problems, you may have found a bug in the build script. In this case, you should report the bug to the crate's author. Missing Dependencies \u00b6 Missing dependencies occur when a dependency is not found in the local registry. This can happen when you are using a dependency that has been removed from the registry, or when you are using a dependency that is not compatible with the other dependencies in your project. How to Fix: Check the crate's name and version: The first step is to check the crate's name and version to make sure that they are correct. Update your local registry: If the crate's name and version are correct, you can try updating your local registry by running cargo update . Use a local path: If you are still having problems, you can try using a local path to the dependency. This is useful when you are working on a project that has not yet been published to the registry. Feature Flag Errors \u00b6 Feature flag errors occur when there is a problem with the feature flags in your project. Feature flags are a way to conditionally compile code, and they are often used to enable or disable certain features in a crate. Conflicting Features \u00b6 Conflicting features occur when two or more of your dependencies enable conflicting features in the same crate. This can happen when you are using a dependency that has not been updated in a while, or when you are using a dependency that is not compatible with the other dependencies in your project. How to Fix: Disable the conflicting features: The first step is to try disabling the conflicting features. You can do this by using the default-features = false option in your Cargo.toml file. Use a version specifier: If disabling the conflicting features does not work, you can try using a version specifier to force Cargo to use a specific version of the crate. Use a patch section: If you are still having problems, you can use a [patch] section in your Cargo.toml file to override the version of a dependency. Missing Features \u00b6 Missing features occur when a dependency requires a feature that is not enabled in your project. This can happen when you are using a dependency that has not been updated in a while, or when you are using a dependency that is not compatible with the other dependencies in your project. How to Fix: Enable the missing feature: The first step is to try enabling the missing feature. You can do this by adding the feature to the features section of your Cargo.toml file. Use a version specifier: If enabling the missing feature does not work, you can try using a version specifier to force Cargo to use a specific version of the crate. Use a patch section: If you are still having problems, you can use a [patch] section in your Cargo.toml file to override the version of a dependency. Workspace Errors \u00b6 Workspace errors occur when there is a problem with the workspace in your project. A workspace is a way to manage multiple crates in a single project. Inconsistent Dependencies \u00b6 Inconsistent dependencies occur when two or more of the crates in your workspace require different versions of the same dependency. This can happen when you are using a dependency that has not been updated in a while, or when you are using a dependency that is not compatible with the other dependencies in your project. How to Fix: Use a [workspace.dependencies] section: The best way to fix this problem is to use a [workspace.dependencies] section in your root Cargo.toml file. This will allow you to specify the version of a dependency for all the crates in your workspace. Use a version specifier: If you cannot use a [workspace.dependencies] section, you can try using a version specifier to force Cargo to use a specific version of the crate. Use a patch section: If you are still having problems, you can use a [patch] section in your Cargo.toml file to override the version of a dependency. Path Issues \u00b6 Path issues occur when Cargo is unable to find a crate in your workspace. This can happen when you have moved a crate to a different directory, or when you have renamed a crate. How to Fix: Check the path to the crate: The first step is to check the path to the crate to make sure that it is correct. Update the [workspace] section: If the path to the crate is correct, you will need to update the [workspace] section in your root Cargo.toml file to reflect the new path. Other Common Errors \u00b6 Linker Errors \u00b6 Linker errors occur when the linker is unable to find a symbol that is referenced in your code. This can happen when you are using a C library that is not properly configured, or when you are using a library that is not compatible with your system. How to Fix: Install the missing library: The first step is to install the missing library. You can do this by using your system's package manager, or by installing the library from source. Check your linker path: If the library is installed, you will need to check your linker path to make sure that the linker can find it. You can do this by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. Use the links key: If you are still having problems, you can use the links key in your Cargo.toml file to tell Cargo how to link to the library. Permission Errors \u00b6 Permission errors occur when you do not have the necessary permissions to access a file or directory. This can happen when you are trying to build a project in a directory that you do not have write access to, or when you are trying to access a file that is owned by another user. How to Fix: Check the permissions of the file or directory: The first step is to check the permissions of the file or directory to make sure that you have the necessary permissions. Change the ownership of the file or directory: If you do not have the necessary permissions, you can try changing the ownership of the file or directory to your user. Use sudo : If you are still having problems, you can try using sudo to run the command with root privileges. However, this should be done with caution as it can be a security risk.","title":"A Guide to Understanding and Resolving Common Cargo Errors"},{"location":"cargo-error-guide/#a-guide-to-understanding-and-resolving-common-cargo-errors","text":"This guide provides a comprehensive overview of common errors that you may encounter when working with Cargo, the Rust build system and package manager.

Table of Contents \u00b6 Overview Core Concepts Directory Structure Implementing a New Feature Testing Best Practices Examples Overview \u00b6 Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters, is an architectural pattern that isolates the core business logic from external concerns. This separation makes the application more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to change. Core Concepts \u00b6 Domain Layer \u00b6 Contains the core business logic Pure Rust code with no external dependencies Defines domain models and business rules Application Layer \u00b6 Orchestrates the flow of data between the domain and infrastructure layers Implements use cases Defines ports (traits) for external interactions Infrastructure Layer \u00b6 Implements the ports defined by the application layer Handles external concerns like: Database access Network communication File I/O External services Directory Structure \u00b6 src/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 domain/ # Domain layer \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 models/ # Domain models \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 services/ # Domain services \u251c\u2500\u2500 application/ # Application layer \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 ports/ # Ports (traits) \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 services/ # Application services \u2514\u2500\u2500 infrastructure/ # Infrastructure layer \u251c\u2500\u2500 adapters/ # Adapters implementing ports \u2514\u2500\u2500 config/ # Configuration Implementing a New Feature \u00b6 1. Define Domain Models \u00b6 // domain/models/user.rs pub struct User { pub id: UserId, pub username: String, pub email: String, } 2. Define Ports (Traits) \u00b6 // application/ports/user_repository.rs #[async_trait] pub trait UserRepository: Send + Sync { async fn find_by_id(&self, id: &UserId) -> Result<Option<User>, Error>; async fn save(&self, user: &User) -> Result<(), Error>; } 3. Implement Application Service \u00b6 // application/services/user_service.rs pub struct UserService<T: UserRepository> { user_repository: Arc<T>, } impl<T: UserRepository> UserService<T> { pub async fn get_user(&self, id: &UserId) -> Result<Option<User>, Error> { self.user_repository.find_by_id(id).await } } 4. Implement Adapters \u00b6 // infrastructure/adapters/postgres_user_repository.rs pub struct PostgresUserRepository { pool: PgPool, } #[async_trait] impl UserRepository for PostgresUserRepository { async fn find_by_id(&self, id: &UserId) -> Result<Option<User>, Error> { // Implementation using SQLx } } Testing \u00b6 Unit Tests \u00b6 Test domain and application layers in isolation: #[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; use mockall::predicate::*; #[tokio::test] async fn test_get_user() { // Setup mock let mut mock_repo = MockUserRepository::new(); mock_repo .expect_find_by_id() .returning(|_| Ok(Some(User::new(\"test\")))); // Test let service = UserService::new(Arc::new(mock_repo)); let result = service.get_user(&UserId::new()).await; assert!(result.is_ok()); } } Integration Tests \u00b6 Test the entire stack: #[tokio::test] async fn test_user_flow() { // Setup test database let pool = setup_test_db().await; // Create repository with test DB let repo = PostgresUserRepository::new(pool); // Test operations let user = User::new(\"test\"); repo.save(&user).await.unwrap(); let found = repo.find_by_id(&user.id).await.unwrap(); assert!(found.is_some()); } Best Practices \u00b6 1. Dependency Rule \u00b6 Dependencies should always point inward: Domain has no dependencies Application depends on domain Infrastructure depends on application and domain 2. Use Traits for Dependencies \u00b6 // Good: Depend on trait struct UserService<T: UserRepository> { repo: T, } // Bad: Depend on concrete implementation struct UserService { repo: PostgresUserRepository, } 3. Error Handling \u00b6 Define domain-specific errors Use thiserror for error types Convert between error types at boundaries 4. Testing \u00b6 Test domain logic in isolation Use mocks for external dependencies Write integration tests for critical paths Examples \u00b6 Domain Event \u00b6 // domain/events/user_created.rs pub struct UserCreated { pub user_id: UserId, pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>, } impl DomainEvent for UserCreated { fn event_type(&self) -> &'static str { \"user_created\" } fn timestamp(&self) -> DateTime<Utc> { self.timestamp } } Command Handler \u00b6 // application/commands/create_user.rs pub struct CreateUserCommand { pub username: String, pub email: String, } pub struct CreateUserHandler<T: UserRepository, E: EventBus> { user_repo: Arc<T>, event_bus: Arc<E>, } #[async_trait] impl<T, E> CommandHandler<CreateUserCommand> for CreateUserHandler<T, E> where T: UserRepository, E: EventBus, { async fn handle(&self, cmd: CreateUserCommand) -> Result<(), Error> { let user = User::new(cmd.username, cmd.email); self.user_repo.save(&user).await?; let event = UserCreated { user_id: user.id, timestamp: Utc::now(), }; self.event_bus.publish(event).await?; Ok(()) } } Conclusion \u00b6 The Hexagonal Architecture provides a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.

Overview \u00b6 The High Availability subsystem provides fault tolerance, automatic failover, and resilience capabilities to Anya Core. It implements a distributed coordination mechanism that ensures service continuity even when individual nodes or components fail. Architecture \u00b6 The HA system follows the hexagonal architecture pattern defined by official Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs): +----------------+ | Cluster API | +-------+--------+ | +----------------+ +-----v--------+ +----------------+ | Discovery | | Cluster | | Monitoring | | Services <--+ Manager +--> & Metrics | | (DNS, K8s, etc)| | | | (Prometheus) | +----------------+ +-------+------+ +----------------+ | +-------v--------+ | Node Management| | & Health Checks| +----------------+ Key Components [AIR-3] \u00b6 Cluster Manager \u00b6 The ClusterManager is the central component of the High Availability subsystem. It manages: Node discovery and registration Leader election Health monitoring Fault detection Automatic failover Configuration synchronization /// Cluster Manager for high availability operations /// \\[AIR-3\\]\\[RES-3\\]\\[SCL-3\\] pub struct ClusterManager { config: ClusterConfig, nodes: HashMap<NodeId, NodeInfo>, current_leader: Option<NodeId>, status: ClusterStatus, } Node Discovery Services [AIR-3] \u00b6 Multiple node discovery mechanisms are supported: Static Configuration : Pre-configured list of nodes DNS Discovery : SRV record-based discovery Kubernetes Discovery : Kubernetes API-based discovery Multicast Discovery : Local network discovery via multicast Membership Service [RES-3] \u00b6 The Membership Service tracks node status and manages: Node join/leave operations Health check protocols Heartbeat monitoring Split-brain detection Quorum-based decisions Health Monitoring [RES-3] \u00b6 Comprehensive health monitoring includes: Regular heartbeat checks Application-level health probes Resource utilization monitoring Response time measurements Error rate tracking Leader Election [AIR-3][RES-3] \u00b6 The leader election algorithm is based on the Raft consensus protocol with the following properties: Safety : At most one leader can be elected in a given term Liveness : A new leader will eventually be elected if the current one fails Fault Tolerance : The system can tolerate up to (N-1)/2 node failures The election process follows these steps: All nodes start in follower state If a follower receives no communication, it becomes a candidate A candidate requests votes from other nodes Nodes vote for at most one candidate per term A candidate becomes the leader if it receives votes from a majority of nodes Fault Detection and Recovery [RES-3] \u00b6 The system detects and handles various failure scenarios: Failure Type Detection Method Recovery Action Node Crash Missed heartbeats Leader election Network Partition Quorum loss Partition healing Performance Degradation Slow response time Load balancing Resource Exhaustion Resource metrics Auto-scaling Application Errors Error rate increase Restart service Configuration Synchronization [AIR-3] \u00b6 The HA subsystem ensures configuration consistency across the cluster: Leader maintains the authoritative configuration Configuration changes are propagated to all nodes Version tracking prevents conflicts Two-phase commit ensures atomic updates Roll-back capability for failed updates Security Considerations [AIS-3] \u00b6 The HA system implements these security measures: TLS Mutual Authentication : All node-to-node communication is encrypted and authenticated Authorization : Role-based access control for administrative operations Audit Logging : All cluster operations are logged with tamper-evident records Network Isolation : Control plane traffic is isolated from data plane Secure Bootstrap : Nodes are securely provisioned with initial credentials Performance Characteristics [AIP-3] \u00b6 The HA subsystem is designed for optimal performance: Low-latency leader election (<500ms in typical conditions) Efficient heartbeat protocol with minimal network overhead Scalable to 100+ nodes without significant performance degradation Configurable monitoring intervals based on deployment requirements Low CPU and memory footprint (<5% of system resources) Bitcoin-Specific Considerations [AIR-3][AIS-3] \u00b6 For Bitcoin operations, the HA system provides additional guarantees: Transaction Consistency : Ensures no double-spending during failover UTXO Set Integrity : Maintains consistent UTXO references across nodes Blockchain State : Synchronizes blockchain view across all nodes HSM Coordination : Manages distributed HSM operations securely DLC Contract Continuity : Ensures DLC contracts remain valid during failover Usage Examples \u00b6 Basic HA Cluster Configuration \u00b6 let config = ClusterConfig { node_id: \"node-1\".to_string(), discovery_method: DiscoveryMethod::Static { nodes: vec![\"node-1:7800\".to_string(), \"node-2:7800\".to_string(), \"node-3:7800\".to_string()], }, bind_address: \"0.0.0.0:7800\".to_string(), heartbeat_interval: Duration::from_secs(1), election_timeout: Duration::from_secs(5), ..Default::default() };

These fixes are meant to be applied after the RC testing is complete, as they don't affect the functional validation of the RC candidate. HSM Module Errors \u00b6 The primary issues in the HSM module are: Missing Type Definitions : Several types referenced in src/security/hsm/mod.rs need to be properly defined Incorrect Imports : Some imports are missing or duplicated Structural Issues : There are references to types that need to be properly structured Required Fixes \u00b6 1. Create HSM Types File \u00b6 Create a new file at src/security/hsm/types.rs with the following core type definitions: use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}; use chrono::{DateTime, Utc}; use std::error::Error; use std::fmt; // Key type definitions #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Serialize, Deserialize)] pub enum KeyType { // Implementation details } // KeyInfo structure #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)] pub struct KeyInfo { // Implementation details } // HSM Audit Event #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)] pub struct HsmAuditEvent { // Implementation details } // Various operation parameter structs #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)] pub struct GenerateKeyParams { // Implementation details } #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)] pub struct SignParams { // Implementation details } #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)] pub struct VerifyParams { // Implementation details } // Other required type definitions 2. Update HSM Provider Status \u00b6 Ensure the HsmProviderStatus enum is properly defined in src/security/hsm/provider.rs : #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Serialize, Deserialize)] pub enum HsmProviderStatus { Ready, Initializing, Error(String), // Other states } 3. Update Bitcoin Imports \u00b6 Fix the bitcoin-related imports by ensuring the proper types are imported: use bitcoin::{Script, ScriptBuf, XOnlyPublicKey, Txid, Psbt}; use bitcoin::taproot::TaprootBuilder; use bitcoin::bip32::ExtendedPrivKey; Implementation Plan \u00b6 Complete RC validation with the current code (ignoring compilation warnings) Create a branch for post-RC fixes Implement the type definitions and import fixes Run comprehensive tests to ensure the fixes don't alter functionality Merge the fixes for the final release Note on Base64 Warnings \u00b6 The deprecated base64 functions should be addressed separately as they're just warnings and don't affect compilation.

The architecture is designed to adhere to Bitcoin Core principles while optimizing resource usage and ensuring comprehensive validation. Core Principles \u00b6 All workflows in Anya Core adhere to the following Bitcoin Core principles: Decentralization : No central dependencies or services that could represent single points of failure. Security : Comprehensive validation with multiple security layers. Immutability : Deterministic builds with environment hashing. Transparency : All validation steps are documented and results are published as artifacts. Architecture Overview \u00b6 The workflow architecture follows a three-tiered structure: Base Layer : Reusable workflow components that set up the environment. Layer 2 : Protocol-specific validation workflows. Application Layer : Integration workflows and summaries. Branch-Based Optimization Strategy \u00b6 Workflows are optimized based on branch type: Main Branch : Full validation with local Bitcoin Core node and hardware acceleration. Development/Feature/RC Branches : Streamlined validation using public RPCs to conserve resources. Reusable Workflow Components \u00b6 .github/workflows/reusable/bitcoin-setup.yml \u00b6 Sets up a Bitcoin validation environment with the following features: Configurable Bitcoin Core version Local or public RPC endpoints based on branch Deterministic environment setup .github/workflows/reusable/rust-bitcoin.yml \u00b6 Configures Rust toolchain with Bitcoin-specific components: Rust stable or nightly based on requirements Bitcoin-specific crates and dependencies Taproot support configuration .github/workflows/reusable/bip-validation.yml \u00b6 Implements comprehensive BIP standards validation: BIP compliance testing Cryptographic validation Standardized reporting Main Workflows \u00b6 Bitcoin Core Workflow ( .github/workflows/bitcoin-core.yml ) \u00b6 Consolidated workflow for Bitcoin Core validation: Replaces previous bitcoin-validation.yml and bitcoin-combined.yml Conditional execution based on branch Full validation for main branch, streamlined for other branches Layer 2 Protocols Workflow ( .github/workflows/layer2-protocols.yml ) \u00b6 Validates all Layer 2 technologies on Bitcoin: Lightning Network validation Discrete Log Contracts (DLCs) validation RGB Smart Contracts validation Stacks blockchain validation RSK (Rootstock) sidechain validation Taproot Assets validation Cross-protocol integration tests Web5 Components Workflow ( .github/workflows/web5-components.yml ) \u00b6 Validates Web5 components: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) validation Handshake protocol validation Web5 API conformance tests Mobile integration tests for React Native Resource Optimization \u00b6 The workflows implement resource optimization strategies: Conditional Execution : Only run comprehensive tests on main branch Public RPC Usage : Use public RPC endpoints for non-main branches Artifact Retention : Only retain essential artifacts Parallel Execution : Run independent validation steps in parallel GitHub MCP Integration \u00b6 The workflows are designed to leverage GitHub MCP tools for: Issue and PR management Repository operations Code search and retrieval Branch management Environment Variables \u00b6 The following environment variables control workflow behavior: MCP_GITHUB_USERNAME : GitHub username for MCP operations MCP_GITHUB_EMAIL : GitHub email for MCP operations MCP_GITHUB_DEFAULT_OWNER : Default repository owner MCP_GITHUB_DEFAULT_REPO : Default repository name BRANCH_TYPE : Automatically determined branch type for optimization Validation Reports \u00b6 Each workflow generates structured validation reports as JSON artifacts: Protocol-specific reports Integration reports Summary reports These reports are uploaded as artifacts and can be used for compliance verification and audit trails. Running Workflows \u00b6 Manual Execution \u00b6 Workflows can be triggered manually with the following parameters: validation_level : Standard or extended validation specific_protocol/component : Focus validation on a specific protocol or component Automated Execution \u00b6 Workflows run automatically on: Push to main branch Push to development, feature, or release candidate branches Pull requests against any of these branches Future Enhancements \u00b6 Planned workflow enhancements: AI Agent Integration : Incorporate AI-driven validation and testing Federated Testing : Implement federated testing across multiple environments Enhanced Mobile Testing : Add more comprehensive mobile platform testing Cross-Repository Integration : Test integration with other Bitcoin projects Troubleshooting \u00b6 Common workflow issues and solutions: RPC Connection Failures : Check if the required Bitcoin Core node is running Rust Build Failures : Verify Rust toolchain configuration Test Failures : Check test logs for specific error messages GitHub Action Limits : Be aware of GitHub Actions usage limits Conclusion \u00b6 This workflow architecture ensures that Anya Core remains aligned with Bitcoin Core principles while optimizing GitHub Actions resource usage.

The framework enables anya-core to deliver optimal performance across diverse hardware platforms including RISC-V, AMD, Intel, and ARM architectures without compromising Bitcoin protocol compliance or consensus safety. By implementing a hexagonal architecture with hardware-specific optimizations, we can achieve significant performance improvements while maintaining the decentralization, security, and immutability principles core to Bitcoin. Motivation \u00b6 Current Bitcoin node implementations are not optimized for the diverse range of hardware architectures in use today. With the rise of RISC-V, continued evolution of x86 architectures (AMD Zen, Intel Core/Xeon), and growing adoption of ARM-based systems, there is significant untapped performance potential. Additionally, specialized hardware accelerators for cryptographic operations remain underutilized. By creating an architecture-aware system that can adapt to the specific capabilities of the underlying hardware, we can: Increase transaction validation throughput by 50-300% depending on hardware Reduce power consumption for equivalent workloads Enhance decentralization by improving performance on a wider range of devices Enable future hardware acceleration without consensus changes Maintain strict Bitcoin protocol compliance across all platforms Specification \u00b6 1.

Implementation Phases \u00b6 Phase 1: Hardware Abstraction Foundation (0-3 months) \u00b6 Implement detection mechanisms for all architectures Establish baseline performance metrics Define acceleration interfaces Create fallback generic implementations Phase 2: Architecture-Specific Optimizations (3-6 months) \u00b6 RISC-V vector and crypto extensions AMD CCX-aware and AVX optimizations Intel AVX-512 and cache optimizations ARM SVE/NEON optimizations Phase 3: Hexagonal Core Refactoring (6-9 months) \u00b6 Refactor consensus code to follow hexagonal principles Create clean port definitions Implement adapters for hardware interfaces Ensure Bitcoin protocol compliance Phase 4: Integration and Testing (9-12 months) \u00b6 Cross-platform validation testing Performance benchmarking Consensus validation against reference implementation Load testing and stress testing Rationale \u00b6 The Universal Adaptive Hardware Optimization Framework addresses several critical needs: Performance Scaling : As Bitcoin continues to grow, node performance requirements increase. Hardware optimization ensures nodes can keep pace with network demands. Broader Hardware Support : Bitcoin's decentralization is strengthened by supporting diverse hardware platforms. This proposal enables optimal performance across RISC-V, AMD, Intel, and ARM architectures. Future-Proofing : The hexagonal architecture with clearly defined interfaces allows for integration of future hardware accelerators without consensus changes. No Consensus Changes : By focusing exclusively on execution optimization rather than consensus rules, we maintain full compatibility with the Bitcoin network. Energy Efficiency : Hardware-specific optimizations reduce power consumption, making node operation more sustainable and cost-effective. Backwards Compatibility \u00b6 The Universal Adaptive Hardware Optimization Framework maintains full compatibility with existing Bitcoin consensus rules and network protocols. It operates entirely within the execution layer, optimizing performance without changing any validation rules. The framework includes fallback implementations for all operations, ensuring that anya-core functions correctly on any hardware platform, including those not specifically optimized. Security Considerations \u00b6 Consensus Safety \u00b6 To ensure consensus safety across different hardware implementations: All optimized implementations must produce identical results to the reference implementation for any given input. Comprehensive test vectors will verify that all architecture-specific optimizations maintain consensus compatibility. Formal verification techniques will be applied to critical cryptographic operations to ensure correctness. Side-Channel Resistance \u00b6 Hardware-specific optimizations must maintain resistance to side-channel attacks: Constant-time implementations for all cryptographic operations, regardless of hardware platform. Memory access patterns that do not leak sensitive information. Power/EM analysis resistance where applicable. Performance Impact \u00b6 Preliminary benchmarks indicate the following expected performance improvements: Architecture Operation Expected Improvement RISC-V Signature Verification 200-300% RISC-V Script Validation 150-250% AMD Zen Signature Verification 50-150% AMD Zen Script Validation 40-100% Intel Signature Verification 50-150% Intel Script Validation 40-100% ARM Signature Verification 100-200% ARM Script Validation 80-150% These improvements translate to higher transaction throughput, reduced block validation times, and more efficient resource utilization. Reference Implementation \u00b6 A reference implementation will be developed in the following stages: Hardware detection framework (Q2 2025) Architecture-specific optimizations (Q3 2025) Hexagonal architecture implementation (Q4 2025) Integration and deployment (Q1 2026) The reference implementation will include comprehensive test suites to verify correctness and performance across all supported architectures.

Table of Contents \u00b6 Section 1 Section 2 This document explains how to set up and use GPG signing for commits in the Anya Core repository. Why Sign Commits? \u00b6 Signing commits provides verification that the commits were actually created by you. This is important for security and authentication, especially in open-source projects. Requirements \u00b6 Git (version 2.0 or higher) GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) Setup Instructions \u00b6 Automatic Setup \u00b6 We provide scripts to automate the setup process: Windows/PowerShell : Run .\\configure-git-signing.ps1 Linux/Mac : Run ./configure-git-signing.sh These scripts will: 1. Configure Git with the proper user name and email 2. Help you select an existing GPG key or create a new one 3. Configure Git to use the selected key for signing 4. Enable commit signing by default Manual Setup \u00b6 1. Check if you have existing GPG keys \u00b6 gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG 2. Create a new GPG key (if needed) \u00b6 gpg --full-generate-key Select RSA and RSA Key size of 4096 bits Set an expiration date (or no expiration) Enter your information (use \"bo_thebig\" as name and \"botshelomokokoka@gmail.com\" as email) Set a secure passphrase 3. Configure Git to use your key \u00b6 Find your key ID from the output of the first command: # Example output # sec rsa4096/ABC123DEF456GHI7 2023-01-01 [SC] # 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF01234567 # uid [ultimate] Your Name <your.email@example.com> The key ID is the part after \"rsa4096/\" (e.g., ABC123DEF456GHI7). Configure Git with your key: git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID git config --global commit.gpgsign true 4. Set up GPG in your environment \u00b6 Windows : You might need to tell Git where to find the GPG executable: git config --global gpg.program \"C:/Program Files (x86)/GnuPG/bin/gpg.exe\" macOS : You might need to tell Git to use GPG2: git config --global gpg.program gpg2 Using Git Signing \u00b6 Committing with Signatures \u00b6 With commit.gpgsign set to true, all your commits will be automatically signed. You can also manually sign a commit: git commit -S -m \"Your commit message\" Adding Your GPG Key to GitHub \u00b6 Export your public key: gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID Copy the entire output (including the BEGIN and END lines) Go to GitHub \u2192 Settings \u2192 SSH and GPG keys \u2192 New GPG key Paste your key and save Retroactively Signing Previous Commits \u00b6 If you have existing commits that need to be signed, we provide scripts to help with this process: Windows/PowerShell : Run .\\scripts\\sign-previous-commits.ps1 Linux/Mac : Run ./scripts/sign-previous-commits.sh These scripts will help you identify and sign previous commits in your branch. By default, they examine the last 10 commits and provide a safe way to rewrite your Git history by adding proper GPG signatures. Usage Examples \u00b6 Windows : # Show help .\\scripts\\sign-previous-commits.ps1 -h # Sign the last 5 commits .\\scripts\\sign-previous-commits.ps1 -CommitCount 5 # Dry run to preview the process without making changes .\\scripts\\sign-previous-commits.ps1 -DryRun Linux/Mac : # Show help ./scripts/sign-previous-commits.sh -h # Sign the last 5 commits ./scripts/sign-previous-commits.sh -c 5 # Dry run to preview the process without making changes ./scripts/sign-previous-commits.sh -d Important Notes on Retroactive Signing \u00b6 Force Push Required : After signing previous commits, you'll need to force push your branch. Caution with Shared Branches : Only use retroactive signing on branches that haven't been used by other contributors, as it rewrites Git history. Public Repositories : For public repositories, consider only signing new commits going forward rather than rewriting history. Troubleshooting \u00b6 \"secret key not available\" \u00b6 This usually means the email in your Git config doesn't match the email in your GPG key. Make sure they match exactly. \"gpg failed to sign the data\" \u00b6 On some systems, you might need to use: export GPG_TTY=$(tty) Add this to your .bashrc or .zshrc file to make it permanent. Windows-specific issues \u00b6 If you're having issues on Windows, try setting the GPG program path: git config --global gpg.program \"C:/Program Files (x86)/GnuPG/bin/gpg.exe\" Commit Signing in Repository Scripts \u00b6 The commit_push.ps1 and commit_push.sh scripts in this repository have been updated to automatically detect if GPG signing is configured and will use it when available.

This document details the implementation of the hexagonal architecture across the system, with a focus on Bitcoin Layer 2 integrations. Core Architecture \u00b6 Domain Layer \u00b6 The domain layer contains the core business logic and rules, independent of external concerns: // Core domain models pub struct Transaction { id: TransactionId, inputs: Vec<Input>, outputs: Vec<Output>, witnesses: Vec<Witness>, metadata: TransactionMetadata } // Domain services pub trait TransactionService { async fn validate(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<ValidationResult>; async fn process(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<ProcessingResult>; async fn verify(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<VerificationResult>; } Application Layer (Ports) \u00b6 The application layer defines the interfaces (ports) that the domain layer uses to interact with external systems: // Input ports (primary/driving) pub trait TransactionPort { async fn submit_transaction(&self, tx: Transaction) -> Result<TransactionId>; async fn get_transaction(&self, id: TransactionId) -> Result<Transaction>; async fn validate_transaction(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<ValidationResult>; } // Output ports (secondary/driven) pub trait BlockchainPort { async fn broadcast_transaction(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<BroadcastResult>; async fn get_block(&self, hash: BlockHash) -> Result<Block>; async fn verify_proof(&self, proof: &Proof) -> Result<VerificationResult>; } Infrastructure Layer (Adapters) \u00b6 The infrastructure layer implements the ports defined in the application layer: // Bitcoin adapter implementation pub struct BitcoinAdapter { rpc_client: BitcoinRpcClient, network: Network, config: BitcoinConfig } impl BlockchainPort for BitcoinAdapter { async fn broadcast_transaction(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<BroadcastResult> { // Implementation } async fn get_block(&self, hash: BlockHash) -> Result<Block> { // Implementation } async fn verify_proof(&self, proof: &Proof) -> Result<VerificationResult> { // Implementation } } Layer 2 Protocol Integration \u00b6 Protocol Adapters \u00b6 Each Layer 2 protocol has its own adapter implementation: // Protocol adapter trait pub trait ProtocolAdapter { async fn submit_transaction(&self, tx: ProtocolTransaction) -> Result<TransactionId>; async fn verify_state(&self, state: &ProtocolState) -> Result<VerificationResult>; async fn sync_state(&self) -> Result<SyncResult>; } // BOB Protocol adapter pub struct BobAdapter { rpc_client: BobRpcClient, state_manager: BobStateManager, verification: BobVerification } // RGB Protocol adapter pub struct RgbAdapter { taproot_client: TaprootClient, asset_manager: RgbAssetManager, state_tracker: RgbStateTracker } // RSK Protocol adapter pub struct RskAdapter { sidechain_client: RskClient, bridge_manager: RskBridgeManager, verification: RskVerification } Protocol Ports \u00b6 Protocol-specific ports define the interfaces for each Layer 2 protocol: // Protocol ports pub trait ProtocolPort { async fn submit_protocol_tx(&self, tx: ProtocolTransaction) -> Result<TransactionId>; async fn verify_protocol_state(&self, state: &ProtocolState) -> Result<VerificationResult>; async fn sync_protocol_state(&self) -> Result<SyncResult>; } // Asset management ports pub trait AssetPort { async fn issue_asset(&self, params: AssetParams) -> Result<AssetId>; async fn transfer_asset(&self, transfer: AssetTransfer) -> Result<TransferResult>; async fn get_asset_state(&self, asset_id: AssetId) -> Result<AssetState>; } Dependency Injection \u00b6 The system uses dependency injection to wire up the hexagonal architecture: // Dependency container pub struct Container { bitcoin_adapter: Arc<BitcoinAdapter>, bob_adapter: Arc<BobAdapter>, rgb_adapter: Arc<RgbAdapter>, rsk_adapter: Arc<RskAdapter> } impl Container { pub fn new(config: Config) -> Self { // Initialize adapters let bitcoin_adapter = Arc::new(BitcoinAdapter::new(config.bitcoin.clone())); let bob_adapter = Arc::new(BobAdapter::new(config.bob.clone())); let rgb_adapter = Arc::new(RgbAdapter::new(config.rgb.clone())); let rsk_adapter = Arc::new(RskAdapter::new(config.rsk.clone())); Self { bitcoin_adapter, bob_adapter, rgb_adapter, rsk_adapter } } } Testing Strategy \u00b6 The hexagonal architecture enables comprehensive testing at each layer: #[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; // Domain layer tests #[tokio::test] async fn test_transaction_validation() { // Test implementation } // Port tests #[tokio::test] async fn test_protocol_port() { // Test implementation } // Adapter tests #[tokio::test] async fn test_bitcoin_adapter() { // Test implementation } } Monitoring and Metrics \u00b6 The system includes comprehensive monitoring and metrics collection: // Metrics collection pub struct MetricsCollector { prometheus_client: PrometheusClient, metrics: Arc<RwLock<Metrics>>, } impl MetricsCollector { pub fn record_transaction(&self, tx: &Transaction) { // Record transaction metrics } pub fn record_protocol_state(&self, protocol: &str, state: &ProtocolState) { // Record protocol state metrics } } Error Handling \u00b6 Error handling is implemented consistently across all layers: // Error types #[derive(Debug, Error)] pub enum HexagonalError { #[error(\"Domain error: {0}\")] Domain(String), #[error(\"Protocol error: {0}\")] Protocol(String), #[error(\"Infrastructure error: {0}\")] Infrastructure(String), } // Error context pub struct ErrorContext { error: HexagonalError, severity: ErrorSeverity, trace_id: Option<String>, retry_count: u32, metrics: ErrorMetrics } Security Considerations \u00b6 The hexagonal architecture ensures security at each layer: Domain Layer Business rule validation State transition verification Access control enforcement Application Layer Input validation Output sanitization Rate limiting Infrastructure Layer Secure communication Authentication Authorization Performance Optimization \u00b6 Performance optimizations are implemented at each layer: Domain Layer Efficient data structures Caching strategies Batch processing Application Layer Connection pooling Request batching Response caching Infrastructure Layer Load balancing Circuit breaking Retry strategies Future Extensions \u00b6 The hexagonal architecture supports easy extension for new protocols and features: New Protocol Integration Implement ProtocolPort Create ProtocolAdapter Add to dependency container New Feature Addition Define domain models Create ports Implement adapters System Evolution Version ports Migrate adapters Update dependencies Bitcoin Layer 2 Integration \u00b6 Protocol Compliance \u00b6 The hexagonal architecture ensures compliance with Bitcoin standards and protocols: // BIP compliance validation pub trait BipCompliance { async fn validate_bip341(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<ValidationResult>; async fn validate_bip342(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<ValidationResult>; async fn validate_bip174(&self, psbt: &PartiallySignedTransaction) -> Result<ValidationResult>; } // Miniscript support pub trait MiniscriptSupport { async fn compile_script(&self, policy: &Policy) -> Result<Script>; async fn analyze_script(&self, script: &Script) -> Result<ScriptAnalysis>; } Layer 2 Protocol Integration \u00b6 Each Layer 2 protocol is integrated through dedicated adapters: // BOB Protocol impl ProtocolAdapter for BobAdapter { async fn submit_transaction(&self, tx: ProtocolTransaction) -> Result<TransactionId> { // Validate against BIP standards self.validate_bip341(&tx).await?; self.validate_bip342(&tx).await?; // Process transaction let result = self.process_transaction(tx).await?; // Record metrics self.metrics.record_transaction(&result); Ok(result.id) } } // RGB Protocol impl ProtocolAdapter for RgbAdapter { async fn submit_transaction(&self, tx: ProtocolTransaction) -> Result<TransactionId> { // Validate Taproot requirements self.validate_taproot(&tx).await?;

This principle ensures that any operation that modifies data first reads the current state before making changes, preventing race conditions and maintaining data integrity in decentralized systems. Core Concepts \u00b6 Read Before Write : Any operation that modifies data (create, update, delete) must first read the current state of that data. Metrics Tracking : All read and write operations are tracked to ensure compliance with the Read First principle. Violation Detection : The system detects and logs situations where a write occurs without a preceding read. Automatic Enforcement : The system is designed to automatically enforce this principle through middleware layers. Implementation Details \u00b6 Web5 DWN Operations \u00b6 In Web5 Decentralized Web Node (DWN) operations, the Read First Always principle is implemented through: ReadFirstDwnManager : A wrapper around standard DWN operations that enforces reads before writes. Metrics Collection : Tracking of read/write operations, timing, and compliance rate. Logging : Comprehensive logging of all operations and potential violations. Example: Creating a Record \u00b6 // Before the Read First Always implementation await web5.dwn.records.create(options); // With Read First Always implementation // 1. First reads similar records await readFirstDwnManager.queryRecords( QueryRecordOptions(schema: options.schema) ); // 2. Then creates the record await readFirstDwnManager.createRecord(options); Example: Updating a Record \u00b6 // Before the Read First Always implementation await web5.dwn.records.update(recordId, options); // With Read First Always implementation // 1. First reads the existing record final existingRecord = await readFirstDwnManager.readRecord(recordId); // 2. Then updates the record await readFirstDwnManager.updateRecord(recordId, options); Benefits \u00b6 Prevents Race Conditions : Ensures all operations have the latest data state. Improves Data Consistency : Maintains integrity across distributed systems. Enables Conflict Detection : Allows early detection of conflicting changes. Simplifies Debugging : Provides clear operation sequences for troubleshooting. Enhances Security : Prevents malicious data corruption through unauthorized writes. Metrics and Monitoring \u00b6 The Read First Always implementation includes comprehensive metrics: Read Count : Total number of read operations. Write Count : Total number of write operations. Violation Count : Number of writes performed without preceding reads. Compliance Rate : Percentage of writes that followed the Read First principle. These metrics are accessible through: final metrics = web5Service.getReadFirstMetrics(); web5Service.logMetrics(); // Logs current metrics to the console Integration with Bitcoin Anchoring \u00b6 The Read First Always principle is particularly important when working with Bitcoin-anchored data in Web5: Transaction Verification : Ensures all Bitcoin transactions are verified before any modification. Credential Validation : Validates all credentials are properly anchored to Bitcoin before updates. Revocation Checks : Verifies credential revocation status on Bitcoin before allowing operations. Best Practices \u00b6 Always Use Provided Managers : Use ReadFirstDwnManager instead of direct DWN operations. Monitor Compliance Metrics : Regularly check and act on Read First Always violation metrics. Include in Testing : Add specific tests to verify Read First compliance in your code. Log Violations : Set up alerts for Read First violations in production systems. Testing \u00b6 The Read First Always principle can be tested using the following approaches: Unit Tests : Test individual components for Read First compliance. Integration Tests : Ensure end-to-end flows maintain the Read First principle. Metrics Validation : Verify metrics are correctly tracking reads and writes. Violation Simulation : Purposely attempt to violate the principle to test detection. Conclusion \u00b6 The Read First Always principle is a cornerstone of data integrity in decentralized systems like Web5. By strictly following this pattern, the Anya Core project maintains consistency and reliability in all data operations, particularly those anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain.

Note: The actual halving interval may be adjusted through governance proposals based on protocol performance metrics. Treasury Management Framework [AIR-3][DAO-3][BPC-3] \u00b6 The Protocol Treasury is managed through the DAO governance system with the following guidelines: Treasury Management Principles \u00b6 Protocol-Owned Liquidity Strategy Minimum of 15% of DEX allocation maintained as protocol-owned liquidity Revenue from protocol operations directed to increase POL over time DAO-controlled trading strategy during extreme market conditions Reserve Requirements Minimum 15% of circulating supply maintained in strategic reserves Reserve ratio adjustable through governance with 75% supermajority Circuit Breakers Treasury operations automatically limited during extreme market volatility Emergency freeze mechanism requiring multi-signature approval Buyback and Burn Mechanism Protocol revenue can be allocated to token buybacks Buyback frequency and amount determined by governance Transparent burn mechanism with on-chain verification Distribution Release Schedule \u00b6 Initial Release \u00b6 Protocol Treasury : 20% available at launch, 80% time-locked Liquidity Provision : 50% available at launch, 50% released over 18 months Team & Development : 0% at launch, 1-year cliff, then

following requirements: Emission Rate Changes : 67% approval, 10% quorum Treasury Allocation Changes : 75% approval, 15% quorum Vesting Schedule Changes : 80% approval, 25% quorum Market Operations \u00b6 The DAO can authorize the following market operations through governance: Liquidity Management Add/remove liquidity from trading pairs Adjust fee tiers and reward distributions Rebalance liquidity across trading venues Buyback Operations Set periodic buyback schedules Establish price targets for buyback execution Determine burn vs. treasury allocation ratio Strategic Investments Allocate treasury funds to ecosystem projects Establish investment criteria and return metrics Manage investment portfolio diversification Implementation Details \u00b6 The tokenomics system is implemented through: Clarity smart contracts for on-chain governance Rust backend for execution and monitoring Web5 DWN for transparent record-keeping ML analytics for market operation optimization Auditing and Transparency \u00b6 All token movements and treasury operations are: Recorded on-chain with transaction hashes Published to a public dashboard Subjected to quarterly independent audits

Table of Contents \u00b6 Section 1 Section 2 This document outlines the rules and best practices for using Visual Studio with AI-assisted development in our project. Core Guidelines \u00b6 Unified Project Structure: Ensure that all source code, modules, and dependencies are organized in a clean, modular structure. Utilize our unified folders (e.g., the modules directory) so that the IDE's navigation, refactoring, and search tools work efficiently. Source Control Integration: Leverage Git and related extensions within Visual Studio for source control management. Regularly commit changes with clear messages. Follow our git submodule structure for managing different modules of the project. Environment Consistency: Adhere to the OPSource-dev environment rules outlined in docs/OPSource-dev.md to maintain consistency between development, testing, and production environments. Use containerization and standardized build tools supported by Visual Studio tasks and launch configurations. AI-Assisted Features: Enable AI-assisted code analysis, debugging, and testing features to improve code quality and productivity. Regularly update the IDE extensions and plugins to benefit from the latest AI capabilities, including intelligent code completion and automated refactoring. Security and Compliance: Follow strict security practices, including regular security scans and adherence to best practices documented in our security files (e.g., SECURITY.md ). Integrate automated security and vulnerability checks directly into your VS development workflow. Documentation and Collaboration: Maintain clear and updated documentation within the repository. Use the integrated documentation tools in Visual Studio to navigate and update guidelines. Use collaboration tools (e.g., Live Share) integrated with Visual Studio to facilitate effective teamwork and real-time code reviews. Additional Best Practices \u00b6 Regularly sync your local repository with the remote to take advantage of automated CI/CD pipelines in our workflows. Leverage task runners and scripts (e.g., scripts/run_tests.sh ) integrated into Visual Studio for a streamlined development process. Ensure that environment variables and configurations are managed securely, using provided configuration files and secret management systems. By following these rules, the development experience on Visual Studio will be optimized with AI-driven features, ensuring rapid development cycles, high code quality, and consistent deployment practices.

Overview of Changes \u00b6 The Bitcoin module has been restructured to follow a clean hexagonal architecture pattern with: Interface Layer Restructuring : Converted a single interface file to a proper directory structure with dedicated interfaces BIP Implementation Modules : Added proper implementations of BIP-341 (Taproot) and BIP-342 (Tapscript) Protocol Modules : Enhanced protocol validation and execution modules SPV Security Improvements : Added constant-time operations for secure verification Error Handling : Enhanced error type handling and propagation Hexagonal Architecture Implementation \u00b6 The implementation follows the hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture pattern, providing clean separation between: Core Domain Logic : Business logic in the center Ports/Interfaces : Clean API definitions that the core exposes Adapters : Implementations that connect to external systems Interface Layer Changes \u00b6 The interface layer has been restructured as follows: src/bitcoin/interface/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 mod.rs # Module registry and primary interface definitions \u251c\u2500\u2500 block.rs # Block-related interfaces \u251c\u2500\u2500 transaction.rs # Transaction-related interfaces \u2514\u2500\u2500 network.rs # Network-related interfaces This provides clear separation of concerns with each interface handling a specific aspect of the Bitcoin protocol: Block Interfaces : Handle block structure, headers, and related information Transaction Interfaces : Handle transaction structure, validation, and related information Network Interfaces : Handle network status, connections, and related operations Protocol Implementation \u00b6 The protocol module has been enhanced with proper validation, script execution, and address utilities: src/bitcoin/protocol/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 mod.rs # Protocol module registry and primary definitions \u251c\u2500\u2500 validation.rs # Protocol and transaction validation \u251c\u2500\u2500 script.rs # Script execution and verification \u2514\u2500\u2500 address.rs # Address generation and validation BIP Implementation Modules \u00b6 A new dedicated BIP implementation module has been created in the core directory: core/src/bip/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 mod.rs # BIP registry and common utilities \u251c\u2500\u2500 bip341.rs # BIP-341 (Taproot) implementation \u2514\u2500\u2500 bip342.rs # BIP-342 (Tapscript) implementation BIP Registry \u00b6 The BIP registry provides a central place to track implementation status of various BIPs: Complete : Fully implemented and tested Partial : Partially implemented Planned : Implementation planned but not started NotSupported : Not supported Currently implemented BIPs: BIP-341 (Taproot) BIP-342 (Tapscript) BIP-174 (PSBT) BIP-370 (PSBT v2) BIP-341 (Taproot) Implementation \u00b6 The Taproot implementation provides full support for: Key path spending Script path spending Merkle tree construction Taproot output creation and verification BIP-342 (Tapscript) Implementation \u00b6 The Tapscript implementation provides full support for: Tapscript execution Control block verification Leaf validation SPV Security Improvements \u00b6 The SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) module has been enhanced with: Constant-time Operations : Added secure, constant-time operations for verification to prevent timing attacks Improved Error Handling : Enhanced error types and propagation Transaction Inclusion Verification : Added comprehensive proof verification Error Handling \u00b6 The error handling has been improved with: Comprehensive Error Types : Added specialized error types for each aspect of Bitcoin operations Error Conversion Implementations : Added conversion implementations from various libraries Context-Specific Error Creation : Added helper methods for creating context-specific errors Validation Tools \u00b6 A new BIP validation tool has been created to verify the implementation: src/bin/verify_bip_modules.rs This tool verifies: Presence of required BIP implementation files Registry entry correctness AI labeling compliance Module structure correctness Benefits of these Changes \u00b6 Improved Maintainability : Clean separation of concerns makes the code easier to maintain Enhanced Testability : Interfaces can be mocked for testing Better Security : Consistent error handling and constant-time operations Simplified Extension : New BIPs can be added in a consistent way Clearer Documentation : Better structure makes the codebase easier to understand Compatibility \u00b6 These changes are backward compatible with existing code that used the previous module structure.

Implementation \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 The Lightning Network implementation in anya-core provides a robust second-layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows for fast, low-cost transactions without the need to record every transaction on the blockchain, significantly improving scalability for Bitcoin applications.

Core Architecture \u00b6 Domain Layer \u00b6 The domain layer contains the core business logic and rules, independent of external concerns: // Core domain models pub struct Transaction { id: TransactionId, inputs: Vec<Input>, outputs: Vec<Output>, witnesses: Vec<Witness>, metadata: TransactionMetadata } // Domain services pub trait TransactionService { async fn validate(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<ValidationResult>; async fn process(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<ProcessingResult>; async fn verify(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<VerificationResult>; } Application Layer (Ports) \u00b6 The application layer defines the interfaces (ports) that the domain layer uses to interact with external systems: // Input ports (primary/driving) pub trait TransactionPort { async fn submit_transaction(&self, tx: Transaction) -> Result<TransactionId>;

This documentation outlines the error handling system and how it should be used. Error Types \u00b6 The error handling system is designed to handle multiple types of errors. These include: System Errors : Errors that occur outside of the control of the system, such as network errors or hardware failures. User Errors : Errors that occur due to user input, such as invalid data or incorrect parameters. Logical Errors : Errors that occur due to the incorrect implementation of a function or system component. Error Handling \u00b6 The error handling system is designed to handle errors in the following way: Error Detection : The system detects an error, either through an exception or through a specific error code. Error Classification : The system determines the type of error that has occurred and takes the appropriate action. Error Reporting : The system logs the error and alerts the user to the fact that an error has occurred. Error Recovery : The system attempts to recover from the error by retrying the operation or performing a rollback. Error Codes \u00b6 The error handling system uses the following error codes to classify and handle errors. 001 : System error. 002 : User error. 003 : Logical error. Error Messages \u00b6 The error handling system uses the following error messages to alert the user to the fact that an error has occurred. 001 : \"System error.

Schnorr Signatures (BIP340) \u00b6 Schnorr signatures offer several benefits over ECDSA: Linearity properties enabling key aggregation Simpler cryptographic security proof Batch verification efficiency Non-malleability /// Create a Schnorr signature pub fn create_schnorr_signature( message: &[u8], private_key: &SecretKey, merkle_root: Option<&[u8; 32]>, ) -> Result<SchnorrSignature, TaprootError> { let secp = Secp256k1::new(); let keypair = KeyPair::from_secret_key(&secp, private_key); // Apply taptweak if merkle root is provided let keypair = if let Some(merkle_root) = merkle_root { let (_, tweaked_seckey) = keypair.tap_tweak(&secp, TapTweakHash::from_slice(merkle_root)?); tweaked_seckey } else { keypair }; // Create message hash let msg_hash = bitcoin::hashes::sha256::Hash::hash(message); let msg = Message::from_digest(msg_hash.to_byte_array()); // Generate signature let sig = secp.sign_schnorr(&msg, &keypair); Ok(sig) } 2. MAST (Merkleized Alternative Script Trees) \u00b6 MAST allows complex scripts to be organized in a tree structure where only the executed path needs to be revealed: /// Create a Taproot script tree with multiple spending conditions pub fn create_taproot_script_tree( internal_key: &XOnlyPublicKey, script_branches: &[(Script, u8, u32)], // (script, leaf_version, relative_weight) ) -> Result<TaprootScriptTree, TaprootError> { let mut builder = taproot::TaprootBuilder::new(); // Add all script branches with their weights for (script, leaf_version, weight) in script_branches { builder = builder.add_leaf_with_ver(*weight, script.clone(), *leaf_version)?; } // Finalize the tree with the internal key let spend_info = builder.finalize(&Secp256k1::new(), *internal_key)?; Ok(TaprootScriptTree { output_key: spend_info.output_key(), merkle_root: spend_info.merkle_root(), control_block_map: spend_info .control_blocks() .iter() .map(|(script, control_block)| (script.clone(), control_block.clone())) .collect(), }) } 3. MuSig2 Key Aggregation \u00b6 MuSig2 enables multiple parties to create a single signature that validates against a single aggregated public key: /// Create a MuSig2 aggregated key from multiple participant keys pub fn create_musig2_aggregated_key( participant_keys: &[XOnlyPublicKey], ) -> Result<XOnlyPublicKey, TaprootError> { // Validate inputs if participant_keys.is_empty() { return Err(TaprootError::InvalidParameter(\"No participant keys provided\".into())); } // Create key aggregation context let secp = Secp256k1::new(); let mut musig_session = musig2::MuSig2::new(&secp, participant_keys)?; // Get aggregated public key let agg_pubkey = musig_session.aggregated_pubkey(); Ok(agg_pubkey) } Integration with Hardware Acceleration \u00b6 Taproot operations benefit significantly from hardware acceleration: /// Verify a Schnorr signature with hardware acceleration pub fn verify_schnorr_signature( message: &[u8], signature: &SchnorrSignature, public_key: &XOnlyPublicKey, ) -> Result<bool, TaprootError> { // Use hardware acceleration if available if hardware_support::is_available() { return hardware_support::verify_schnorr(message, signature, public_key) .map_err(|e| TaprootError::HardwareError(format!(\"Hardware verification error: {}\", e))); } // Software fallback let secp = Secp256k1::new(); let msg_hash = bitcoin::hashes::sha256::Hash::hash(message); let msg = Message::from_digest(msg_hash.to_byte_array()); Ok(secp.verify_schnorr(signature, &msg, public_key).is_ok()) } Wallet Integration \u00b6 Creating Taproot Addresses \u00b6 /// Generate a Taproot address from a public key pub fn create_taproot_address( public_key: &XOnlyPublicKey, merkle_root: Option<&[u8; 32]>, network: Network, ) -> Result<Address, TaprootError> { let secp = Secp256k1::new(); // Create Taproot spending info let spending_info = if let Some(merkle_root) = merkle_root { taproot::TaprootSpendInfo::new_key_spend_only( &secp, *public_key, TapTweakHash::from_slice(merkle_root)? ) } else { taproot::TaprootSpendInfo::new_key_spend_only( &secp, *public_key, None ) }; // Create address from output key let address = Address::p2tr( &Secp256k1::new(), spending_info.internal_key(), spending_info.merkle_root(), network, ); Ok(address) } Signing with Taproot Keys \u00b6 /// Sign a transaction with a Taproot key pub fn sign_taproot_transaction( psbt: &mut Psbt, input_index: usize, private_key: &SecretKey, merkle_root: Option<&[u8; 32]>, ) -> Result<(), TaprootError> { let secp = Secp256k1::new(); let keypair = KeyPair::from_secret_key(&secp, private_key); // Apply taptweak if merkle root is provided let keypair = if let Some(merkle_root) = merkle_root { let (_, tweaked_seckey) = keypair.tap_tweak(&secp, TapTweakHash::from_slice(merkle_root)?); tweaked_seckey } else { keypair }; // Sign the input let xonly_pubkey = XOnlyPublicKey::from_keypair(&keypair).0; psbt.sign_taproot_input( &secp, input_index, &keypair, Some(xonly_pubkey), None, )?; Ok(()) } Layer 2 Integration \u00b6 Taproot significantly enhances Layer 2 capabilities: 1. Lightning Network with Taproot \u00b6 /// Create a Taproot-enhanced Lightning channel pub fn create_taproot_lightning_channel( funding_amount: u64, local_key: &SecretKey, remote_pubkey: &XOnlyPublicKey, expiry_height: u32, ) -> Result<TaprootLightningChannel, TaprootError> { // Create basic channel structure let mut channel = TaprootLightningChannel::new(funding_amount); // Generate key pair from local key let secp = Secp256k1::new(); let keypair = KeyPair::from_secret_key(&secp, local_key); let local_pubkey = XOnlyPublicKey::from_keypair(&keypair).0; // Create cooperative close script let coop_close_script = Script::new_v1_p2tr_multi( &secp, vec![local_pubkey, *remote_pubkey], ); // Create force close with timelock script let force_close_script = create_timelock_script(local_pubkey, expiry_height)?; // Add script paths to channel channel.add_script_path(\"cooperative_close\", coop_close_script, 100); channel.add_script_path(\"force_close\", force_close_script, 10); // Finalize channel construction channel.finalize(&secp)?; Ok(channel) } 2. RGB Assets with Taproot \u00b6 /// Issue RGB assets using Taproot for enhanced privacy pub fn issue_rgb_asset_with_taproot( issuer_key: &SecretKey, asset_name: &str, total_supply: u64, metadata: &[u8], ) -> Result<RgbAsset, TaprootError> { // Generate key pair from issuer key let secp = Secp256k1::new(); let keypair = KeyPair::from_secret_key(&secp, issuer_key); let issuer_pubkey = XOnlyPublicKey::from_keypair(&keypair).0; // Create RGB contract terms let mut contract = RgbContract::new(asset_name, issuer_pubkey); contract.set_total_supply(total_supply); contract.set_metadata(metadata); // Create Taproot structure embedding RGB commitments let rgb_commitment = contract.create_commitment(); // Create issuance transaction with Taproot output let issuance_tx = create_taproot_transaction_with_commitment( &keypair, rgb_commitment, )?; // Register RGB contract on-chain let asset = RgbAsset { asset_id: contract.generate_asset_id(), contract, issuance_tx, }; Ok(asset) } 3. Discrete Log Contracts (DLCs) with Taproot \u00b6 /// Create a DLC using Taproot for improved privacy pub fn create_taproot_dlc( oracle_pubkeys: &[XOnlyPublicKey], outcomes: &[DlcOutcome], collateral_amount: u64, party_a_key: &SecretKey, party_b_pubkey: &XOnlyPublicKey, ) -> Result<TaprootDlc, TaprootError> { // Create DLC contract structure let mut dlc = TaprootDlc::new(collateral_amount); // Generate key pair for party A let secp = Secp256k1::new(); let keypair = KeyPair::from_secret_key(&secp, party_a_key); let party_a_pubkey = XOnlyPublicKey::from_keypair(&keypair).0; // Create adaptor signatures for each outcome let mut outcome_scripts = Vec::new(); for outcome in outcomes { // Create payout script for this outcome let outcome_script = create_dlc_outcome_script( &party_a_pubkey, party_b_pubkey, outcome, )?; outcome_scripts.push((outcome_script, outcome.weight)); } // Create MuSig2 aggregate key for all oracles let oracle_agg_key = create_musig2_aggregated_key(oracle_pubkeys)?; // Create Taproot DLC structure dlc.set_party_a_pubkey(party_a_pubkey); dlc.set_party_b_pubkey(*party_b_pubkey); dlc.set_oracle_key(oracle_agg_key); dlc.add_outcome_scripts(outcome_scripts); // Finalize DLC construction dlc.finalize(&secp)?; Ok(dlc) } Best Practices \u00b6 1. Security Considerations \u00b6 Key Management : Secure storage and handling of Taproot keys Signature Verification : Always verify signatures before accepting transactions Script Validation : Thorough validation of Taproot scripts Privacy Protection : Avoid exposing script paths unnecessarily 2. Performance Optimization \u00b6 Use batch verification for multiple signatures Leverage hardware acceleration where available Optimize script tree structures for common spending paths 3.

Bitcoin-Style Tokenomics \u00b6 The Anya DAO implements a Bitcoin-inspired tokenomics model with the following key properties: Fixed Supply : 21 billion tokens (21,000,000,000) Halving Schedule : Block rewards halve every 210,000 blocks, mirroring Bitcoin's emission schedule Initial Block Reward : 5,000 tokens per block The distribution follows the principle of limited supply and decreasing inflation, ensuring long-term value preservation. +-------------------------------+ | Token Supply: 21 billion | +-------------------------------+ | - DEX Allocation: 30% | | - Team Allocation: 15% | | - DAO/Community: 45% | | - Protocol Reserve: 10% | +-------------------------------+ Taproot Asset Support \u00b6 The tokenomics implementation provides first-class support for Taproot Assets via the verification layer: ;; Verify Taproot asset commitment (define-public (verify-taproot-asset (tx-hash (buff 32)) (merkle-proof (list 10 (buff 32)))) (let ( (taproot-contract (contract-call? (var-get taproot-verifier) verify-taproot-commitment merkle-proof)) ) (asserts! (unwrap! taproot-contract (err ERR_TAPROOT_VERIFICATION_FAILED)) (err ERR_TAPROOT_VERIFICATION_FAILED)) (ok true) )) This integration allows assets issued on the Bitcoin network to be verified and utilized within the DAO governance system, creating a trustless bridge between Bitcoin and the DAO operation. BitVM Integration \u00b6 The DAO implements BitVM verification to enable more complex off-chain computations that can be verified on-chain: Periodic Verification : Every ~2 hours (12 blocks) Cross-Chain Validation : Ensures integrity of operations across chains Verification Enforcement : Core functions require BitVM verification ;; BitVM verification check (define-private (check-bitvm-verification) (let ( (last-verified (var-get last-bitvm-verification)) (current-block block-height) (verification-blocks (var-get bitvm-verification-blocks)) ) (if (> (- current-block last-verified) verification-blocks) (begin (var-set last-bitvm-verification current-block) true) true) )) Cross-Chain DAO Operations \u00b6 The Bitcoin-compatible DAO supports cross-chain operations with the following Layer 2 technologies: Lightning Network : Fast payments and micro-transactions RGB Protocol : Complex asset issuance and management RSK Sidechain : Smart contract functionality BOB (Bitcoin Optimistic Blockchain) : Optimistic execution DLC (Discreet Log Contracts) : Conditional payment channels Integration Flow \u00b6 Bitcoin L1 -> Taproot Verification -> DAO Actions | +-> Lightning Network -> Fast Governance Actions | +-> RGB Protocol -> Asset Management | +-> RSK/BOB -> Complex Governance Logic | +-> DLC -> Conditional Treasury Management Taproot-Verified Voting Mechanism \u00b6 The DAO implements a voting mechanism that requires Taproot verification for certain high-impact governance decisions: Proposal Creation : Standard on-chain transaction Voting Weight : Based on token holdings Critical Decisions : Require Taproot SPV proof from Bitcoin Vote Execution : Contingent on BitVM verification for complex operations Verification Process \u00b6 1. Voter signs transaction with Taproot-compatible wallet 2. Transaction is included in Bitcoin block 3. SPV proof is generated and submitted to DAO 4. DAO contract verifies the proof using verify-taproot-asset 5. Vote is counted with Bitcoin-backed verification Buyback Mechanism \u00b6 The token economics implementation includes an automated buyback mechanism with the following features: Dynamic Pricing : Adjusts based on market conditions Liquidity Management : Maintains price stability Bitcoin Settlement : Can settle via Lightning Network for efficiency Metrics Tracking : Records impact for transparency ;; Auto-buyback implementation with dynamic pricing (define-public (execute-auto-buyback (amount uint)) (begin (asserts! (is-authorized tx-sender) (err ERR_UNAUTHORIZED)) (asserts! (> amount u0) (err ERR_ZERO_AMOUNT)) (asserts! TAPROOT-VERIFICATION-ENABLED (err ERR_TAPROOT_VERIFICATION_FAILED)) (asserts! (check-bitvm-verification) (err ERR_BITVM_VERIFICATION_FAILED)) ;; Calculate dynamic buyback parameters based on market conditions (let ( (market-liquidity (+ (var-get dex-liquidity-reserve) amount)) (price-impact (/ (* amount u10000) market-liquidity)) ;; Basis points (current-block block-height) ) ;; Update buyback metrics (map-set buyback-metrics current-block { last-buyback-block: current-block, buyback-amount: amount, price-impact: price-impact, market-liquidity: market-liquidity }) ;; Update reserves (var-set buyback-reserve (+ (var-get buyback-reserve) amount)) (ok true) ) )) Bitcoin-Backed Treasury Management \u00b6 The DAO treasury implements Bitcoin-standard security practices: Multi-signature : Requires multiple signers for large withdrawals Time-locked Reserves : Critical funds under timelock Threshold Signature : Uses MuSig2 for signature aggregation Cold Storage Integration : Option for high-security Bitcoin vault Implementation Compliance \u00b6 The implementation adheres to official Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), with the following BIP support: BIP Implementation Description Status 340 Schnorr Signatures Basis for Taproot signatures Fully Implemented 341 Taproot Core verification model Fully Implemented 342 Tapscript Script verification Fully Implemented 174 PSBT Transaction construction Fully Implemented 370 Proof format Merkle proof structure Fully Implemented Mobile Integration \u00b6 The DAO supports mobile integration via React Native using the Taproot wallet specification: // React Native TurboModule integration import { createTaprootAsset } from '@rgb-sdk'; const assetMetadata = { name: 'DAOVoteToken', supply: 21000000, precision: 8 }; const issuanceTx = await createTaprootAsset({ network: 'bitcoin', metadata: JSON.stringify(assetMetadata), tapTree: 'tr(KEY,{SILENT_LEAF})' }); Conclusion \u00b6 This Bitcoin-compatible DAO implementation establishes a complete bridge between Bitcoin network security and DAO governance, ensuring that: Token economics mirror Bitcoin's sound monetary principles Governance decisions can be cryptographically verified on Bitcoin Cross-chain operations maintain security guarantees Treasury management follows Bitcoin best practices The result is a DAO system that inherits the security properties of Bitcoin while enabling the flexible governance required for decentralized organizations.

Cross-Chain Execution \u00b6 Bitcoin SPV Proof Verification (BPC-3 compliant) RSK Bridge Integration with Taproot support Legal Compliance Wrappers (DAO-4 standard) Overview \u00b6 The Anya DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is the governance layer for the Anya Core Platform, enabling token holders to collectively manage the protocol, treasury, and ecosystem development. Governance Token \u00b6 The Anya Governance Token (AGT) is the core utility and governance token of the platform. Token Economics \u00b6 Total Supply : 21,000,000,000 AGT (Fixed) Initial Block Reward : 10,000 AGT Emission Schedule : Adaptive Bitcoin-inspired halving mechanism Minimum halving interval: 105,000 blocks Halving controlled by governance parameters Token Distribution \u00b6 The AGT token is distributed according to the following model: 40% Protocol Treasury (8.4B AGT) 20% Strategic Reserves (BIP-341 compliant) 20% Ecosystem Development (DAO-4 managed) 30% Liquidity Provision (6.3B AGT) 20% Initial DEX Liquidity (Taproot-enabled) 10% Ongoing Liquidity Mining (BIP-174 PSBT) 15% Team & Development (3.15B AGT) 5-year vesting with 2-year cliff Performance milestones (BPC-3 verified) 10% Community Incentives (2.1B AGT) Governance participation rewards Protocol usage incentives 5% Strategic Partners (1.05B AGT) 3-year vesting schedule For detailed tokenomics information, see TOKENOMICS_SYSTEM.md Governance Framework \u00b6 Proposal Types \u00b6 The DAO supports multiple proposal types, each with specific requirements and voting parameters: Protocol Upgrades Contract upgrades Parameter changes Feature additions/removals Treasury Management Fund allocations Investment decisions Protocol-owned liquidity operations Emission Schedule Adjustments Halving interval modifications Block reward changes Special emission events Community Grants Developer grants Marketing initiatives Community projects Governance System Changes Voting mechanism updates Proposal threshold adjustments Quorum requirement changes Proposal Process \u00b6 Submission Phase Minimum 100 AGT to submit a proposal 3-day discussion period Technical feasibility review Voting Phase 10-day duration (BPC-3 minimum) 65% participation threshold (DAO-4 standard) Taproot voting proofs (BIP-341) PSBT transaction validation (BIP-174) Execution Phase 2-day timelock before execution Automatic execution for approved proposals Multi-signature security for treasury operations Voting Power \u00b6 Voting power in the DAO is determined by: AGT token holdings Governance participation history Reputation score (based on contribution) Treasury Management \u00b6 The DAO treasury is managed according to the following principles: Treasury Composition \u00b6 Strategic Reserves : 15% minimum of circulating supply Protocol-Owned Liquidity : Minimum 15% of DEX allocation Ecosystem Fund : Grants and investments Operations Fund : Protocol development and maintenance Treasury Operations \u00b6 The DAO can authorize various treasury operations: Liquidity Management Adding/removing DEX liquidity Fee tier adjustments Rebalancing across venues Buyback and Burn Token buybacks from market Burning mechanisms Supply adjustment operations Strategic Investments Protocol investments Ecosystem funding Partnership development Reserve Management Asset diversification Yield generation Risk management Treasury Guards \u00b6 To ensure responsible treasury management: Spending Limits : Tiered approval requirements based on amount Circuit Breakers : Emergency pause during extreme conditions Time Locks : Graduated waiting periods based on impact Audits : Quarterly independent audits Implementation Architecture \u00b6 The DAO is implemented using: On-Chain Components \u00b6 Governance Contract : Main DAO contract Treasury Contract : Treasury management Token Contract : AGT token implementation Proposal Registry : Tracks all proposals Off-Chain Components \u00b6 DAO Dashboard : Web interface for governance Analytics Suite : Governance metrics and insights Notification System : Alerts for proposals and votes Discussion Forum : Proposal discussion platform Security Measures \u00b6 The DAO implements multiple security layers: Multi-Signature Requirements : For critical operations Time Locks : Delayed execution of significant changes Security Council : Emergency response capability Formal Verification : Of all governance contracts Bug Bounty Program : For vulnerability reporting Taproot Audits : Quarterly Tapscript verification PSBT Validation : Hardware wallet integration checks BIP Compliance : Automated protocol checks Weekly BIP-341 signature validation Daily BIP-174

Integration Testing : Multi-contract interaction testing in simulated environments. Economic Simulation : Testing economic incentive mechanisms against various attack scenarios. Governance Simulation : Testing governance processes with multiple signers and proposal types. Deployment and Upgrade Strategy \u00b6 Phased Deployment : Gradual transition from centralized to decentralized control. Initial Parameter Setting : Conservative initial governance parameters to be adjusted over time. Upgrade Mechanisms : On-chain governance process for approving contract upgrades. Emergency Controls : Time-limited emergency controls with multi-sig and high thresholds. Conclusion \u00b6 The fully decentralized DAO architecture represents a significant evolution from the previous hybrid model, eliminating single points of control while maintaining operational efficiency. By implementing multi-signature governance, a decentralized oracle network, and shared libraries, we've created a more secure, transparent, and maintainable system. This architecture aligns with blockchain best practices and ensures that the DAO can operate in a truly decentralized manner, with decisions made collectively by stakeholders rather than individual administrators.","title":"Fully Decentralized DAO Architecture"},{"location":"dao/FULLY_DECENTRALIZED_ARCHITECTURE/#fully-decentralized-dao-architecture","text":"This document describes the fully decentralized architecture of the Anya-core DAO, explaining the design principles, implementation details, and operational considerations.","title":"Fully Decentralized DAO Architecture"},{"location":"dao/FULLY_DECENTRALIZED_ARCHITECTURE/#core-principles","text":"Elimination of Single Points of Control : Replacement of single-owner administrative controls with multi-signature governance and timelocks.

It is responsible for building and testing the entire project, including the core system, enterprise features, and all dependencies. The build system is designed to be highly configurable and extensible. It uses a combination of Cargo and custom build scripts to build the project. Overview \u00b6 The build system is organized into the following components: build.rs : This is the main build script that is responsible for building the entire project. scripts/ : This directory contains additional build scripts that are used by the build system. build/ : This directory contains the build configuration files, such as Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock . How it Works \u00b6 The build system works as follows: The build.rs script is executed by Cargo when the project is built. The build.rs script calls the build_all function, which is responsible for building the entire project. The build_all function builds each of the components of the project, including the core system, enterprise features, and all dependencies. The build_all function also runs the tests for each component. The build_all function outputs the build artifacts, such as the executable and the documentation. Customization \u00b6 The build system can be customized by modifying the build configuration files, such as Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock . The build system can also be customized by modifying the build scripts, such as build.rs and the scripts in the scripts/ directory. Extensibility \u00b6 The build system is designed to be extensible. New components can be added to the project by creating a new directory in the components/ directory and adding a build.rs script to that directory. The build.rs script should call the build_all function to build the component. The build_all function will automatically build the component and run its tests. Additional Resources \u00b6 Additional resources for the build system can be found in the following locations: The build/ directory contains the build configuration files, such as Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock .

This is critical for ensuring that a project is secure, as vulnerabilities in dependencies can be exploited to gain access to the project's components. This process involves checking for known vulnerabilities in dependencies, which can be done using tools such as cargo audit and cargo deny . Why is Dependency Auditing Important? \u00b6 Dependency auditing is important because it helps to ensure that a project is secure. When a project uses a dependency that has a known vulnerability, it makes it easier for an attacker to exploit that vulnerability. This is particularly important for projects that deal with sensitive information, such as financial data or personal information. How to Conduct Dependency Auditing \u00b6 Dependency auditing can be conducted in several ways. The most common approach is to use a tool such as cargo audit or cargo deny to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies. This can be done using the following steps: Install the tool using cargo by running cargo install cargo-audit or cargo install cargo-deny . Run the tool by running cargo audit or cargo deny in the root of the project directory. Review the output to identify any known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Update the dependency to the latest version to fix the vulnerability. Best Practices for Dependency Auditing \u00b6 Dependency auditing should be done regularly to ensure that a project is secure. This can be done by: Running dependency auditing tools regularly to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Ensuring that dependencies are kept up to date, so that any security patches are applied.

It is essential to ensure that the code works as expected and that any new code does not break existing functionality. The testing process is important for the development of the Anya framework, as it helps to identify and fix bugs early on. It is also important for the users of the Anya framework, as it ensures that the code is reliable and that the users can trust the results. Types of Testing \u00b6 There are several types of testing that are important for the Anya framework. These include: Unit Testing : This is the process of testing individual units of code to ensure that they behave as expected. Unit tests are important for the development of the Anya framework, as they help to identify and fix bugs early on. Integration Testing : This is the process of testing multiple units of code together to ensure that they interact correctly. Integration tests are important for the development of the Anya framework, as they help to identify and fix bugs that may arise from the interaction of multiple units ofcode. System Testing : This is the process of testing the entire Anya framework to ensure that it works as expected. System tests are important for the development of the Anya framework, as they help to identify and fix bugs that may arise from the interaction of multiple components of the framework. Acceptance Testing : This is the process of testing the Anya framework to ensure that it meets the requirements of the users. Acceptance tests are important for the development of the Anya framework, as they help to ensure that the code is reliable and that the users can trust the results. Writing Tests \u00b6 Writing tests is an important part of the testing process. When writing tests, it is important to keep the following in mind: Test Code is Just as Important as Production Code : Test code should be written with the same care and attention to detail as production code. This means that the code should be well-organized, well-documented, and easy to understand. Tests Should be Independent : Tests should be written such that they do not depend on any other tests. This makes it easier to run individual tests and to diagnose problems. Tests Should be Fast : Tests should be fast and efficient. This makes it easier to run tests frequently and to diagnose problems quickly. Tests Should be Reliable : Tests should be reliable and should not fail unexpectedly. This makes it easier to trust the results of the tests. Running Tests \u00b6 Running tests is an important part of the testing process. When running tests, it is important to keep the following in mind: Run Tests Frequently : Tests should be run frequently to ensure that the code is working as expected. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs early on. Run All Tests : All tests should be run to ensure that the code is working as expected. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs that may arise from the interaction of multiple units of code. Test in Different Environments : Tests should be run in different environments to ensure that the code is working as expected in different scenarios. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs that may arise from the interaction of multiple components of the framework. Test with Different Input : Tests should be run with different input to ensure that the code is working as expected with different input. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs that may arise from the interaction of multiple components of the framework.","title":"Testing"},{"location":"dependencies/testing/#testing","text":"Documentation for Testing","title":"Testing"},{"location":"dependencies/testing/#overview","text":"Testing is a crucial part of the Anya framework.

Concepts \u00b6 Semantic Versioning \u00b6 Semantic Versioning is a versioning scheme used to keep track of changes to the Anya project. It is based on the following rules: The version number is divided into three parts: x.y.z . The first part, x , is the major version number. This version number is incremented when there are breaking changes to the API. The second part, y , is the minor version number. This version number is incremented when there are new features or enhancements, but no breaking changes. The third part, z , is the patch version number. This version number is incremented when there are only bug fixes. Versioning Scheme \u00b6 The versioning scheme used in the Anya project is based on the following formula: x.y.z-rc.X or x.y.z-rc.X-dev.Y . The first part, x.y.z , is the semantic version number. The second part, -rc.X , is the release candidate number. The third part, -dev.Y , is the development version number. Version Control \u00b6 The Anya project uses a git repository for version control. The repository is hosted on GitHub. Release Process \u00b6 The release process is as follows: Branch from main to create a new branch for the release. Update the version number in the Cargo.toml file. Create a pull request to merge the branch into main . Once the pull request has been approved, merge the branch into main . Tag the release. Push the tag to the remote repository. Tools \u00b6 cargo \u00b6 The cargo command line tool is used to manage the version of the Anya project. cargo-audit \u00b6 The cargo-audit command line tool is used to audit the dependencies used in the Anya project for security vulnerabilities. cargo-deny \u00b6 The cargo-deny command line tool is used to deny certain dependencies from being used in the Anya project. cargo-watch \u00b6 The cargo-watch command line tool is used to watch the project for changes and rebuild the project automatically. rustfmt \u00b6 The rustfmt command line tool is used to format the code in the Anya project.","title":"Version Management"},{"location":"dependencies/version-management/#version-management","text":"This documentation provides information about the version management strategy used in the Anya project.","title":"Version Management"},{"location":"dependencies/version-management/#concepts","text":"","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"dependencies/version-management/#semantic-versioning","text":"Semantic Versioning is a versioning scheme used to keep track of changes to the Anya project.

This document outlines the error handling strategy and patterns used throughout the Anya Core codebase. Table of Contents \u00b6 Error Types Error Handling Patterns Error Propagation Logging and Monitoring Best Practices Common Error Scenarios Error Types \u00b6 1. Domain Errors \u00b6 Errors that represent business logic failures. #[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)] pub enum DomainError { #[error(\"Invalid input: {0}\")] ValidationError(String), #[error(\"Resource not found: {0}\")] NotFound(String), #[error(\"Conflict: {0}\")] Conflict(String), #[error(\"Authentication failed\")] AuthenticationError, #[error(\"Authorization failed: {0}\")] AuthorizationError(String), } 2. Infrastructure Errors \u00b6 Errors from external systems and infrastructure. #[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)] pub enum InfrastructureError { #[error(\"Database error: {0}\")] DatabaseError(#[from] sqlx::Error), #[error(\"IO error: {0}\")] IoError(#[from] std::io::Error), #[error(\"Network error: {0}\")] NetworkError(String), #[error(\"External service error: {0}\")] ExternalServiceError(String), } 3. Application Errors \u00b6 Errors specific to application logic and use cases. #[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)] pub enum ApplicationError { #[error(\"Invalid operation: {0}\")] InvalidOperation(String), #[error(\"Rate limit exceeded\")] RateLimitExceeded, #[error(\"Request timeout\")] Timeout, #[error(\"Configuration error: {0}\")] ConfigurationError(String), } Error Handling Patterns \u00b6 1. Using thiserror for Error Types \u00b6 use thiserror::Error; #[derive(Error, Debug)] pub enum MyError { #[error(\"Invalid input: {0}\")] Validation(String), #[error(\"IO error: {0}\")] Io(#[from] std::io::Error), #[error(\"Database error: {0}\")] Database(#[from] sqlx::Error), } 2. Result Type Alias \u00b6 pub type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, MyError>; fn process_data(data: &[u8]) -> Result<ProcessedData> { // Function implementation } 3. Error Conversion \u00b6 impl From<reqwest::Error> for MyError { fn from(err: reqwest::Error) -> Self { MyError::NetworkError(err.to_string()) } } Error Propagation \u00b6 Using the ? Operator \u00b6 fn process_file(path: &str) -> Result<Data> { let content = std::fs::read_to_string(path)?; // Automatically converts io::Error to MyError let data: Data = serde_json::from_str(&content)?; // Automatically handles serde_json::Error Ok(data) } Contextual Errors \u00b6 use anyhow::{Context, Result}; fn process_config() -> Result<()> { let config = std::fs::read_to_string(\"config.toml\") .context(\"Failed to read config file\")?; let _settings: Settings = toml::from_str(&config) .context(\"Failed to parse config file\")?; Ok(()) } Logging and Monitoring \u00b6 Structured Logging \u00b6 use tracing::{error, info, warn}; async fn process_request(request: Request) -> Result<Response> { info!(request_id = %request.id, \"Processing request\"); let result = some_operation().await .map_err(|e| { error!( error = %e, request_id = %request.id, \"Failed to process request\" ); e })?; Ok(Response::new(result)) } Metrics \u00b6 use metrics::{counter, histogram}; pub async fn process_item(item: Item) -> Result<()> { let start = std::time::Instant::now(); let result = process(item).await; let elapsed = start.elapsed(); histogram!(\"process_item_duration_seconds\", elapsed.as_secs_f64()); match &result { Ok(_) => counter!(\"process_item_success_total\", 1), Err(e) => { counter!(\"process_item_error_total\", 1); error!(\"Failed to process item: {}\", e); } } result } Best Practices \u00b6 1. Use Descriptive Error Messages \u00b6 // Bad #[error(\"Error\")] // Good #[error(\"Failed to parse configuration file: {path}\")] 2. Include Context \u00b6 // Bad read_file(path).await?; // Good read_file(path).await .with_context(|| format!(\"Failed to read file: {}\", path))?; 3. Handle Errors Appropriately \u00b6 match some_operation().await { Ok(result) => process(result), Err(MyError::NotFound(_)) => handle_not_found(), Err(MyError::RateLimitExceeded) => retry_after_delay().await, Err(e) => return Err(e.into()), } Common Error Scenarios \u00b6 1. Database Errors \u00b6 pub async fn get_user(user_id: Uuid) -> Result<User> { sqlx::query_as!( User, \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1\", user_id ) .fetch_optional(&pool) .await? .ok_or_else(|| DomainError::NotFound(format!(\"User {} not found\", user_id))) } 2. Network Requests \u00b6 pub async fn fetch_data(url: &str) -> Result<Data> { let response = reqwest::get(url) .await .map_err(|e| InfrastructureError::NetworkError(e.to_string()))?; if !response.status().is_success() { return Err(InfrastructureError::NetworkError( format!(\"Request failed with status: {}\", response.status()) )); } response.json().await .map_err(|e| InfrastructureError::NetworkError(e.to_string())) } 3. Input Validation \u00b6 pub struct Email(String); impl Email { pub fn new(email: &str) -> Result<Self> { if !email.contains('@') { return Err(DomainError::ValidationError( \"Invalid email format\".to_string() )); } Ok(Self(email.to_string())) } } Testing Error Handling \u00b6 Unit Tests \u00b6 #[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; use assert_matches::assert_matches; #[test] fn test_invalid_email() { let result = Email::new(\"invalid-email\"); assert_matches!(result, Err(DomainError::ValidationError(_))); } #[tokio::test] async fn test_user_not_found() { let result = get_user(Uuid::new_v4()).await; assert_matches!(result, Err(DomainError::NotFound(_))); } } Integration Tests \u00b6 #[tokio::test] async fn test_network_failure() { let server = mockito::Server::new(); let _m = server .mock(\"GET\", \"/data\") .with_status(500) .create(); let result = fetch_data(&server.url()).await; assert_matches!(result, Err(InfrastructureError::NetworkError(_))); } Monitoring and Alerting \u00b6 Log Analysis \u00b6 # Search for errors in logs journalctl -u anya-core --since \"1 hour ago\" | grep -i error # Count errors by type cat app.log | grep ERROR | awk '{print $5}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr Alerting Rules \u00b6 groups: - name: anya-core-errors rules: - alert: HighErrorRate expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~\"5..\"}[5m]) > 0.1 for: 10m labels: severity: critical annotations: summary: \"High error rate on {{ $labels.instance }}\" description: \"{{ $value }}% of requests are failing\" Conclusion \u00b6 Proper error handling is crucial for building reliable and maintainable applications. By following these patterns and best practices, we can ensure that Anya Core handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful feedback to users and developers.

Web5Store \u00b6 The Web5Store is the main entry point for data operations: // Create a new store let store = Web5Store::new().await?; // Basic operations store.create_record(\"users\", data).await?; store.get_record(\"record_id\").await?; store.update_record(\"record_id\", new_data).await?; store.delete_record(\"record_id\").await?; // Query records let results = store.query_records(\"users\", Some(filter)).await?; 2. Read First Always Principle \u00b6 The Read First Always principle is a fundamental data consistency pattern implemented throughout Web5 components: // Use the ReadFirstDwnManager instead of direct DWN operations let manager = ReadFirstDwnManager::new(Arc::new(web5_client)); // Create operation (will automatically query similar records first) let record = manager.create_record(&CreateRecordOptions { data: serde_json::to_string(&data)?, schema: \"https://schema.org/VerifiableCredential\".to_string(), data_format: \"application/json\".to_string(), })?; // Update operation (will automatically read the record first) let updated_record = manager.update_record(&record.id, &UpdateRecordOptions { data: serde_json::to_string(&updated_data)?, data_format: \"application/json\".to_string(), })?; // Get metrics for compliance monitoring let metrics = manager.get_metrics(); println!(\"Read count: {}, Write count: {}, Compliance: {}%\", metrics.read_count, metrics.write_count, metrics.compliance_rate()); For detailed information, see the Read First Always documentation . 3. Caching System \u00b6 The caching system provides performance optimization: // Configure cache let config = CacheConfig { max_size: NonZeroUsize::new(1000).unwrap(), default_ttl: Some(Duration::from_secs(3600)), notify_on_evict: true, }; // Use cached operations let result = store.get_cached(\"key\").await?; store.set_cached(\"key\", value, Some(ttl)).await?; 4. Batch Operations \u00b6 For efficient bulk data processing: // Batch configuration let options = BatchOptions { max_concurrent: 10, stop_on_error: false, timeout: Duration::from_secs(30), }; // Perform batch operations let records = vec![/* ... */]; let results = store.bulk_create(\"users\", records).await?; // Update multiple records let updates = HashMap::new(); updates.insert(\"id1\", json!({ \"status\": \"active\" })); updates.insert(\"id2\", json!({ \"status\": \"inactive\" })); store.bulk_update(\"users\", updates).await?; 5. Event System \u00b6 The event system enables real-time notifications: // Create event subscriber let subscriber = EventSubscriber::new(&event_bus) .filter_by_type(EventType::RecordCreated) .filter_by_source(\"web5_store\"); // Listen for events while let Some(event) = subscriber.receive().await { println!(\"Received event: {:?}\", event); } // Publish custom events event_publisher.publish_event( EventType::Custom(\"user_action\"), data, Some(\"correlation_id\"), Some(\"user_id\"), vec![\"custom_tag\"], ).await?; 6.

Error Handling \u00b6 // Use custom error types #[derive(Error, Debug)] pub enum StoreError { #[error(\"Validation error: {0}\")] ValidationError(String), #[error(\"Record not found: {0}\")] NotFound(String), } // Handle errors with context match operation { Ok(result) => process_result(result), Err(e) => log_error_with_context(e, \"Operation failed\"), } 2. Async Operations \u00b6 // Use async/await consistently async fn process_data() -> Result<(), Error> { let data = fetch_data().await?; process_in_background(data).await?; Ok(()) } // Handle concurrent operations let results = futures::future::join_all(operations).await; 3. Testing \u00b6 #[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; #[tokio::test] async fn test_store_operations() { let store = setup_test_store().await; // Test operations } } Performance Optimization \u00b6 1. Caching Strategy \u00b6 Use appropriate cache sizes Set reasonable TTL values Monitor cache hit rates Implement cache warming 2. Batch Processing \u00b6 Choose optimal batch sizes Use rate limiting Handle partial failures Monitor batch performance 3. Query Optimization \u00b6 Use efficient filters Implement pagination Cache frequent queries Monitor query performance Monitoring and Debugging \u00b6 1. Logging \u00b6 // Use structured logging log::info!(\"Operation completed: {}\", operation_id); log::error!(\"Operation failed: {}\", error); 2. Metrics \u00b6 // Record custom metrics metrics_collector.record_performance_metric( \"query\", \"user_search\", duration, ).await; 3. Health Checks \u00b6 // Implement custom health checks async fn check_component_health() -> ComponentHealth { // Perform health check ComponentHealth { status: SystemStatus::Healthy, message: Some(\"Component operational\"), details: None, } } Security Considerations \u00b6 1. Authentication \u00b6 Always validate DIDs Implement proper access control Use secure communication 2. Data Validation \u00b6 Validate all input data Use schema validation Sanitize user input 3. Error Handling \u00b6 Don't expose internal errors Log security events Implement rate limiting Contributing \u00b6 1.

Architecture \u00b6 The configuration management system follows a hexagonal architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns and a focus on flexibility and extensibility. +------------------+ | | | Configuration | | Manager | | | +--------+---------+ | | +-------------------+-+-------------------+ | | | +--------v---------+ +-------v--------+ +--------v---------+ | | | | | | | Configuration | | Configuration | | Configuration | | Sources | | Validation | | Consumers | | | | | | | +------------------+ +----------------+ +------------------+ | | | | | | +--------v---------+ +-------v--------+ +--------v---------+ | File | Env | | Type | Format | | System | User | | Source | Source | | | | | | | +--------+---------+ +-------+--------+ +--------+---------+ Core Components \u00b6 Configuration Manager Central hub for all configuration operations Manages configuration state and history Provides validation and event notification Thread-safe with RwLock protection Configuration Sources File-based (YAML, JSON, TOML) Environment variables Command-line arguments User input (CLI/UI) Programmatic API Default values Configuration Validation Type validation Range validation (min/max) Pattern matching (regex) Enumeration validation Custom validation rules Configuration Consumers System components User applications External services Key Features \u00b6 Multi-Source Configuration The system can load configuration from multiple sources with a defined precedence order: User Input > Command Line > Environment Variables > Config Files > Defaults This allows for flexible configuration management with appropriate overrides. Type-Safe Configuration All configuration values are strongly typed with validation: rust pub enum ConfigValue { String(String), Integer(i64), Float(f64), Boolean(bool), Array(Vec<ConfigValue>), Map(HashMap<String, ConfigValue>), Null, } Configuration Validation Configurable validation rules for each configuration key: rust pub enum ValidationRule { Required, MinValue(f64), MaxValue(f64), MinLength(usize), MaxLength(usize), Pattern(String), Enum(Vec<ConfigValue>), Custom(Arc<dyn Fn(&ConfigValue) -> Result<(), ValidationError> + Send + Sync>), } Change Tracking and History All configuration changes are tracked with history: rust pub struct ConfigChangeEvent { pub key: String, pub old_value: Option<ConfigValue>, pub new_value: ConfigValue, pub source: ConfigSource, pub timestamp: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>, } Event-Based Notification Components can subscribe to configuration changes: rust pub type ConfigChangeListener = Arc<dyn Fn(&ConfigChangeEvent) -> () + Send + Sync>; Sensitive Configuration Configuration values can be marked as sensitive for security: rust config_manager.mark_as_sensitive(\"security.api_key\", true); Implementation \u00b6 The configuration management system is implemented in the src/core/config_management.rs file with the following key components: ConfigManager : Central configuration management ConfigValue : Type-safe configuration values ConfigSource : Configuration sources ValidationRule : Configuration validation rules ConfigChangeEvent : Configuration change events CONFIG_MANAGER : Global configuration manager instance Usage Examples \u00b6 Basic Configuration Access \u00b6 // Access the global configuration manager let config = &crate::core::CONFIG_MANAGER; // Set a configuration value config.set_value( \"system.auto_save_frequency\", ConfigValue::Integer(20), ConfigSource::Default ).unwrap(); // Get a configuration value let auto_save_frequency = config.get_integer(\"system.auto_save_frequency\").unwrap(); Loading Configuration from File \u00b6 // Load configuration from a JSON file config.load_from_file(&PathBuf::from(\"config.json\")).unwrap(); // Load configuration from a YAML file config.load_from_file(&PathBuf::from(\"config.yaml\")).unwrap(); // Load configuration from a TOML file config.load_from_file(&PathBuf::from(\"config.toml\")).unwrap(); Loading Configuration from Environment \u00b6 // Load configuration from environment variables with the ANYA_ prefix config.load_from_env(\"ANYA_\").unwrap(); Adding Validation Rules \u00b6 // Add validation rules config.add_validation_rule(\"system.auto_save_frequency\", ValidationRule::MinValue(1.0)); config.add_validation_rule(\"system.auto_save_frequency\", ValidationRule::MaxValue(100.0));

Choose the installation method that best suits your needs: Interactive Installation: A user-friendly, guided installation process that helps you configure your system. Non-Interactive Installation: A scriptable installer for automated deployments. Prerequisites \u00b6 Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following minimum requirements: Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian recommended) or macOS. Windows users should use WSL2. CPU: 2 cores Memory: 4 GB RAM Disk Space: 100 GB Software: Rust 1.70.0 or later Docker Git Interactive Installation \u00b6 The interactive installer guides you through the installation process, helping you choose the right profile for your needs and verifying your system's compatibility. 1. Run the Installer \u00b6 To start the interactive installer, run the following command from the root of the repository: cargo run --bin anya_installer 2. Follow the Prompts \u00b6 The installer will prompt you for the following information: Installation Directory: The directory where Anya Core will be installed. The default is /opt/anya-core . Verbose Output: Whether to display detailed output during installation. Installation Profile: The type of installation you want to perform. 3. Choose an Installation Profile \u00b6 The installer offers several profiles, each tailored to a specific use case: Auto-Configure (Recommended): Automatically detects your hardware and selects the best profile for your system. Minimal Node: A lightweight installation with minimal features, suitable for resource-constrained environments. Standard Node: A balanced installation with a standard set of features. Full Archive Node: A complete installation with all features and a full copy of the blockchain. Enterprise Cluster: A high-performance installation for enterprise use cases. 4. Complete the Installation \u00b6 Once you've answered all the prompts, the installer will perform the following steps: Check System Dependencies: Verifies that all required system packages and Rust crates are installed, and installs any missing dependencies. Verify System Requirements: Ensures your system meets the minimum hardware requirements. Apply Hardware-Optimized Configuration: Configures the system based on your hardware for optimal performance. Generate and Validate Bitcoin Configuration: Creates a bitcoin.conf file with the appropriate settings for your chosen profile. Validate BIP Compliance: Verifies that your system is compliant with the required Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Run Security Audit: Performs a security audit of your system. Set up Monitoring and Services: Configures systemd services and log rotation. Generate Audit Log: Creates a detailed audit log of the installation process. Non-Interactive Installation \u00b6 The non-interactive installer is designed for automated deployments and scripting. 1. Run the Installer \u00b6 To use the non-interactive installer, run the following command from the root of the repository: cargo run --bin anya_installer -- --non-interactive install --profile <profile> Replace <profile> with one of the following: minimal , standard , full-node , enterprise , or auto . 2. Command-Line Options \u00b6 You can customize the installation with the following command-line options: --install-dir <path> : Sets the installation directory. --non-interactive : Skips all interactive prompts. --verbose : Enables verbose output. Verifying the Installation \u00b6 After the installation is complete, you can verify it by running the following command: anya-cli status Checking System Requirements \u00b6 You can check if your system meets the requirements without running the full installer: cargo run --bin anya_installer check Uninstalling Anya Core \u00b6 To uninstall Anya Core, run the following command: cargo run --bin anya_installer uninstall Note: The uninstall feature is not yet implemented. Updating an Existing Installation \u00b6 To update an existing installation, run the following command: cargo run --bin anya_installer update Note: The update feature is not yet implemented. The anya-install Binary \u00b6 The anya-install binary provides a non-interactive, component-based installation process. It is suitable for advanced users and automated deployments that require fine-grained control over the installed components. 1. Run the Installer \u00b6 To use the anya-install binary, run the following command from the root of the repository: cargo run --bin anya-install -- --config <config_file> --modules <components> 2. Command-Line Options \u00b6 -c, --config <FILE> : Specifies a custom configuration file. -m, --modules <COMPONENTS> : A comma-separated list of components to install (e.g., core,bitcoin,dao ). -n, --network <NETWORK> : The Bitcoin network type ( mainnet , testnet , regtest ). --rpc-endpoint <URL> : A custom Bitcoin RPC endpoint. -v, --verify : Verifies the installation after it's complete. 3. Installation Process \u00b6 The anya-install binary performs the following steps: Verifies System Requirements: Checks for the required software and hardware. Loads Configuration: Loads the specified configuration file. Installs Components: Installs the specified components. Verifies Installation: If the --verify flag is present, it verifies the installation. Generates Deployment Configuration: Creates a docker-compose.yml and .env file for deployment.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"getting-started/INSTALLATION/#anya-core-installation-guide","text":"This guide provides comprehensive instructions for installing Anya Core.

document here. Table of Contents \u00b6 Section 1 Section 2 Bitcoin RPC Configuration \u00b6 Anya-Core uses public RPC endpoints by default: Mainnet: https://bitcoin-rpc.publicnode.com Testnet: https://bitcoin-testnet-rpc.publicnode.com These endpoints are provided by PublicNode.com which offers free, privacy-focused RPC services.

Understand the Key Differences \u00b6 // Synchronous API (Old) let layer2_manager = Layer2Manager::new(); layer2_manager.initialize_all()?; let protocol = layer2_manager.get_protocol(ProtocolType::Bob)?; let result = protocol.submit_transaction(&transaction)?; // Asynchronous API (New) let layer2_manager = Layer2Manager::new(); layer2_manager.initialize_all_async().await?; let protocol = layer2_manager.get_protocol_async(ProtocolType::Bob).await?; let result = protocol.submit_transaction_async(&transaction).await?; 2. Update Dependencies \u00b6 Ensure your Cargo.toml has the appropriate dependencies: [dependencies] tokio = { version = \"1.28\", features = [\"full\"] } async-trait = \"0.1.68\" futures = \"0.3\" 3. Update Function Signatures \u00b6 Change function signatures to use async/await: // Before fn process_transaction(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<TxStatus> { let protocol = self.layer2_manager.get_protocol(ProtocolType::Bob)?; protocol.submit_transaction(&tx) } // After async fn process_transaction(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<TxStatus> { let protocol = self.layer2_manager.get_protocol_async(ProtocolType::Bob).await?; protocol.submit_transaction_async(&tx).await } 4. Update Main Function \u00b6 If you're using the async API in your main function, update it to use tokio runtime: // Before fn main() -> Result<()> { let app = MyApp::new(); app.run() } // After #[tokio::main] async fn main() -> Result<()> { let app = MyApp::new(); app.run_async().await } 5. Update Tests \u00b6 Update tests to use async test utilities: // Before #[test] fn test_transaction_submission() { let manager = Layer2Manager::new(); // ... test code } // After #[tokio::test] async fn test_transaction_submission() { let manager = Layer2Manager::new(); // ... async test code } API Reference \u00b6 Layer2Manager Async Methods \u00b6 Sync Method Async Equivalent Description initialize_all() initialize_all_async() Initialize all Layer2 protocols get_protocol() get_protocol_async() Get a Layer2 protocol implementation by type cross_layer_transfer() cross_layer_transfer_async() Perform cross-layer asset transfer verify_cross_layer_proof() verify_cross_layer_proof_async() Verify cross-layer transfer proof Protocol-Specific Async Methods \u00b6 Each protocol implementation provides async versions of all methods: Sync Method Async Equivalent initialize() initialize_async() submit_transaction() submit_transaction_async() get_transaction_status() get_transaction_status_async() transfer_asset() transfer_asset_async() verify_proof() verify_proof_async() Advanced Usage Patterns \u00b6 Concurrent Operations \u00b6 The async API enables easy concurrent operations: use futures::future::join_all; async fn process_multiple_transactions(transactions: Vec<Transaction>) -> Vec<Result<TxStatus>> { let layer2_manager = Layer2Manager::new(); layer2_manager.initialize_all_async().await?; let protocol = layer2_manager.get_protocol_async(ProtocolType::Bob).await?; let futures = transactions.iter() .map(|tx| protocol.submit_transaction_async(tx)) .collect::<Vec<_>>(); join_all(futures).await } Error Handling \u00b6 Error handling with async code is similar to synchronous code: async fn safe_process(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<TxStatus> { match self.layer2_manager.get_protocol_async(ProtocolType::Bob).await { Ok(protocol) => { match protocol.submit_transaction_async(&tx).await { Ok(status) => Ok(status), Err(e) => { log::error!(\"Transaction submission failed: {}\", e); Err(e) } } }, Err(e) => { log::error!(\"Failed to get protocol: {}\", e); Err(e) } } } Compatibility Notes \u00b6 Both synchronous and asynchronous APIs will be maintained in parallel Implementations using the synchronous API will continue to work For maximum performance, especially in high-concurrency scenarios, we recommend migrating to the async API Performance Considerations \u00b6 Async API shows the largest performance gains in I/O-bound operations Best practices include batching operations and using connection pooling For detailed performance analysis, see docs/layer2/ASYNC_PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON.md Support and Feedback \u00b6 If you encounter issues migrating to the async API, please file an issue with the tag async-migration .

Table of Contents \u00b6 Section 1 Section 2 Introduction \u00b6 This document provides an overview of the Read First Always principle implementation in the Web5 components of the Anya Core project. This implementation enhances data integrity and consistency in decentralized systems by ensuring that all write operations are preceded by reads of the current state. Implementation Files \u00b6 The Read First Always principle is implemented across the following files: lib/src/core/web5/metrics.react : Metrics tracking for Read First compliance lib/src/core/web5/read_first_dwn.react : DWN wrapper that enforces the Read First principle lib/src/core/web5/web5_service.react : Updated service with Read First principle integration lib/src/core/storage/dwn_store.react : Storage implementation with Read First principle compliance docs/READ_FIRST_ALWAYS.md : Comprehensive documentation of the principle test/web5/read_first_test.dart : Test suite for Read First functionality Key Features \u00b6 1. Read First Enforcement \u00b6 All operations that modify data are required to first read the current state: Create operations : Query for similar records before creating new ones Update operations : Read the current record before updating Delete operations : Verify record exists before deleting 2. Metrics Collection \u00b6 Detailed metrics are collected to monitor compliance: Read count : Number of read operations performed Write count : Number of write operations performed Violation count : Number of writes without preceding reads Compliance rate : Percentage of writes that comply with Read First 3. Logging \u00b6 Comprehensive logging is implemented for: All read and write operations Potential violations of the Read First principle Periodic metrics summaries Integration With Bitcoin Anchoring \u00b6 The Read First Always principle is particularly important for Bitcoin-anchored Web5 operations: It ensures that all operations verify the current blockchain state before making changes It prevents potential conflicts in credential issuance and verification It maintains consistency between on-chain and off-chain data Usage Examples \u00b6 Basic Usage \u00b6 // Get the Web5Service instance final web5Service = await Web5Service.connect(); // All operations automatically follow Read First Always principle await web5Service.createRecord( collection: 'credentials', data: credentialData, schema: 'https://schema.org/VerifiableCredential', ); // Get compliance metrics final metrics = web5Service.getReadFirstMetrics(); print('Compliance rate: ${metrics['compliance_rate']}%'); Direct DWN Manager Usage \u00b6 // Access the ReadFirstDwnManager final web5Client = web5.Web5Client(); final dwnManager = ReadFirstDwnManager(web5Client); // Operations will follow Read First Always principle await dwnManager.createRecord( web5.CreateRecordOptions( data: jsonEncode(data), dataFormat: 'application/json', schema: schema, ), ); Testing \u00b6 The Read First principle implementation includes comprehensive tests that verify: All write operations are preceded by reads Metrics are correctly tracked and reported Exceptions are properly thrown for invalid operations Read/write order is maintained in all cases Run the tests with: flutter test test/web5/read_first_test.dart Conclusion \u00b6 The Read First Always principle is a critical component of the Anya Core Web5 implementation, ensuring data consistency and integrity across decentralized operations. By enforcing reads before writes, we maintain the reliability of our Web5 and Bitcoin-anchored services.

Core Bitcoin Principles \u00b6 Our Taproot implementation adheres strictly to Bitcoin's core principles: Decentralization : No trusted third parties are required Security : Robust cryptographic primitives secure all operations Privacy : Transactions maintain privacy through indistinguishability Immutability : Once committed, data cannot be altered Verifiability : All claims are cryptographically verifiable Key-Path Spending \u00b6 Key-path spending represents the simplest and most efficient Taproot spending path: // Generate key-path Taproot output function createTaprootKeyPathOutput(internalKey) { // Apply BIP-341 tweak to internal key const outputKey = tweakInternalKey(internalKey); return { scriptPubKey: 'OP_1 ' + outputKey, type: 'p2tr' }; } // Spend with a key-path signature function createTaprootKeyPathSignature(privateKey, txHash) { // Generate BIP-340 compliant Schnorr signature const signature = schnorr.sign(txHash, privateKey); return signature; } Key-Path Best Practices \u00b6 Use secure randomness for all key generation Implement constant-time operations for all cryptographic functions Avoid key reuse across different applications Verify signatures before broadcasting transactions Script-Path Spending \u00b6 Script-path spending unlocks Taproot's full power through complex spending conditions while maintaining privacy: // Create a Taproot Merkle tree with script paths function createTaprootScriptTree(internalKey, scripts) { const leaves = scripts.map(script => createTapLeaf(script)); const merkleRoot = computeMerkleRoot(leaves); const outputKey = tweakInternalKey(internalKey, merkleRoot); return { outputKey, scriptPubKey: 'OP_1 ' + outputKey, type: 'p2tr', leaves }; } // Create a Taproot script spend function createScriptPathSpend(scriptTree, scriptIndex, controlBlock) { const selectedScript = scriptTree.leaves[scriptIndex].script; return { witness: [ /* witness stack elements */, selectedScript, controlBlock ] }; } SILENT_LEAF Implementation \u00b6 To maximize privacy, our implementation uses the SILENT_LEAF paradigm: // Create a privacy-preserving TapLeaf function createTapLeaf(script, version = 0xc0) { // 0xc0 = SILENT_LEAF version const leaf = tapLeafHash(version, script); return { version, script, hash: leaf }; } Privacy Considerations \u00b6 Our Taproot implementation optimizes for privacy: Indistinguishability : Key-path spends are indistinguishable from simple single-sig transactions SILENT_LEAF : Script-path spends reveal minimal information Randomized Ordering : Merkle paths are randomly ordered to prevent fingerprinting Limited Metadata : No unnecessary metadata is included in transactions Web5 Integration \u00b6 Web5 components integrate with Taproot through: DID Anchoring : Decentralized Identifiers are anchored using Taproot commitments Verifiable Credentials : Credentials can be selectively disclosed using script paths DWNs (Decentralized Web Nodes) : Reference Taproot proofs for verification // Anchor a DID to Bitcoin using Taproot async function anchorDIDWithTaproot(did, publicKey) { // Create taproot output with DID commitment in script path const didCommitment = createDIDCommitmentScript(did); const scriptTree = createTaprootScriptTree(publicKey, [didCommitment]); // Build and broadcast transaction const tx = await buildTransaction(scriptTree); return await broadcastTransaction(tx); } Discrete Log Contracts (DLCs) \u00b6 DLCs provide a way to create private, non-custodial contracts based on oracle attestations. Taproot enables more efficient and private DLCs by hiding the contract logic within its tree structure. DLC Implementation with Taproot \u00b6 Our implementation of DLCs leverages Taproot to enhance both privacy and efficiency: Contract Structure : Each outcome is represented as a Tapscript leaf in the Taproot tree The contract uses TAPROOT_SILENT_LEAF (0xc0) for maximum privacy All possible outcomes are hidden until execution, making the contracts indistinguishable from regular transactions Oracle Integration : Oracles provide attestations using Schnorr signatures Signature verification is done with constant-time operations to prevent timing attacks DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) are used to identify and authenticate oracles Contract Execution : Key-path spending is used for cooperative settlements (happy path) Script-path spending is used for unilateral settlements (disputed outcomes) Adaptor signatures ensure that only the intended parties can claim their payouts Web5 Integration : DLC contracts are anchored to Web5 DIDs for provenance and identity verification Commitments to DLC outcomes are embedded in Taproot transactions The entire system preserves user privacy while allowing verifiable outcomes Cross-input Schnorr Signature Aggregation \u00b6 To further enhance privacy and reduce transaction sizes, we've implemented cross-input signature aggregation: Size Optimization : Traditional multi-input transactions require one signature per input With aggregation, a single signature can authorize multiple inputs This can reduce transaction size by up to 40% for multi-input transactions Privacy Enhancement : Multi-input transactions become indistinguishable from single-input ones Obscures the relationship between inputs, enhancing user privacy Makes blockchain analysis more difficult for potential observers Implementation : Three aggregation modes: None, CrossInput, and CrossInputMuSig CrossInput provides basic aggregation across inputs CrossInputMuSig adds MuSig for multi-party signing with a single aggregate key Compatibility : Works seamlessly with Taproot transactions Compatible with BIP-341 script-path spending Preserves all security properties of individual signatures // Cross-input signature aggregation pub fn sign_with_aggregation( &self, transaction: &Transaction, inputs: &[SignableInput], ) -> Result<AggregatedSignature, AggregationError> { // Calculate sighashes for all inputs let mut sighashes = Vec::with_capacity(inputs.len()); let mut input_indexes = Vec::with_capacity(inputs.len()); for input in inputs { sighashes.push(self.calculate_sighash(transaction, input)); input_indexes.push(input.index); } // Create a combined message by hashing all sighashes together let mut combined_hash = [0u8; 32]; let mut hasher = bitcoin::hashes::sha256::Hash::engine(); for sighash in &sighashes { bitcoin::hashes::Hash::hash(sighash, &mut hasher); } let hash = bitcoin::hashes::sha256::Hash::from_engine(hasher); combined_hash.copy_from_slice(&hash[..]); // Sign the combined message let message = Message::from_slice(&combined_hash) .map_err(|_| AggregationError::SigningFailed)?; let signature = self.secp.sign_schnorr(&message, &inputs[0].private_key); // Calculate size savings let individual_size = inputs.len() * 64; let aggregated_size = 64; let size_savings = individual_size - aggregated_size; // Calculate privacy score let privacy_score = std::cmp::min(100, (inputs.len() as u8 - 1) * 25 + 25); Ok(AggregatedSignature { signature, input_indexes: input_indexes.to_vec(), size_savings, privacy_score, }) } Performance Optimization \u00b6 Our implementation includes several performance optimizations: Batch Verification : Multiple signatures are verified in a single operation Script Caching : Common script templates are cached for reuse Aggressive Pruning : Merkle paths are pruned to minimize data size Signature Aggregation : Cross-input signature aggregation reduces transaction size Security Considerations \u00b6 Key Management : Securely manage the internal keys for Taproot outputs. Constant-time Verification : Always use constant-time operations for cryptographic functions to prevent timing attacks. Hash Function Selection : Use tagged hashes as specified in BIP-340 to prevent cross-protocol attacks. Oracle Security : Verify that oracles use appropriate key management practices and secure attestation processes. Adaptor Signature Safety : Adaptor signatures must be carefully implemented to avoid leaking private information. Secure Random Number Generation : Always use cryptographically secure random number generators for nonces and other random values. Transaction Malleability : Design contracts to be resistant to transaction malleability attacks. Verifiable Execution : All contract outcomes should be independently verifiable by all parties. Signature Aggregation Security : When using signature aggregation, ensure that the signers are properly authenticated and authorized. Fee Estimation : Properly estimate fees for Taproot transactions, especially when using script-path spending which may require larger witnesses. Testing Recommendations \u00b6 Test all execution paths in Taproot scripts Verify correct leaf versions (0xc0 for enhanced privacy) Ensure compatibility with various wallet software Test with the BIP-341 test vectors Test DLC contracts with multiple outcomes and participants Verify oracle attestation verification with both valid and invalid signatures Test cross-input signature aggregation with different numbers of inputs Verify size savings and privacy enhancements from signature aggregation Test MuSig key aggregation for multi-party contracts Ensure all cryptographic operations resist timing attacks Verify proper handling of edge cases (e.g., single-input aggregation, no leaves) Test with different network configurations (mainnet, testnet, signet) Verify integration with Web5 DIDs and anchoring Test serialization and deserialization of contract data Benchmark performance for large contracts with many outcomes Test Vectors \u00b6 We've implemented comprehensive test vectors from the BIP specifications: // BIP-340 Test Vector 1 const bip340Vector1 = { privateKey: '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003', publicKey: 'F9308A019258C31049344F85F89D5229B531C845836F99B08601F113BCE036F9', auxRand: '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', message: '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', signature: 'E907831F80848D1069A5371B402410364BDF1C5F8307B0084C55F1CE2DCA821525F66A4A85EA8B71E482A74F382D2CE5EBEEE8FDB2172F477DF4900D310536C', verification: true }; // BIP-341 Key-Path Test Vector const keyPathVector = { internalKey: \"cc8a4bc64d897bddc5fbc2f670f7a8ba0b386779106cf1223c6fc5d7cd6fc115\", tweak: \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\", outputKey: \"a60869f0dbcf1dc659c9cecbaf8050135ea9e8cdc487053f1dc6880949dc684c\" }; // More test vectors available in full test suite For complete test coverage, refer to the test directory .

Table of Contents \u00b6 Section 1 Section 2 This guide explains how to test the Read First Always principle implementation in both React and Rust components of the Anya Core project. Prerequisites \u00b6 Make sure you have the following development tools installed: Dart SDK (2.19 or higher) Flutter (3.7 or higher) Rust (1.70 or higher) Cargo package manager Clone the repository and check out the feature branch: bash git clone https://github.com/Anya-org/OPSource.git cd OPSource git checkout feature/read-first-always-main Testing the Dart Implementation \u00b6 Running the Unit Tests \u00b6 Navigate to the anya-core directory: bash cd anya-core Run the Dart tests specifically for the Read First implementation: bash flutter test test/web5/read_first_test.dart To run all tests including the Read First implementation: bash flutter test Manual Testing \u00b6 You can manually test the Read First implementation by integrating it into your application: ```dart import 'package:anya_core/src/core/web5/web5_service.dart'; // Initialize the Web5 service (automatically uses Read First) final web5Service = await Web5Service.connect(); // Create a record (will automatically read similar records first) await web5Service.createRecord( collection: 'notes', data: {'content': 'This is a test note'}, schema: 'https://schema.org/TextDigitalDocument', ); // Get metrics to verify Read First compliance final metrics = web5Service.getReadFirstMetrics(); print('Read count: ${metrics[\"read_count\"]}'); print('Write count: ${metrics[\"write_count\"]}'); print('Compliance rate: ${metrics[\"compliance_rate\"]}%'); ``` Testing the Rust Implementation \u00b6 Running the Unit Tests \u00b6 Navigate to the anya-core directory: bash cd anya-core Run the Rust tests specifically for the Web5 agent: bash cargo test --package anya-core --lib src/ml/agents/web5_agent To run all tests including the Web5 agent: bash cargo test Manual Testing \u00b6 You can manually test the Rust implementation by integrating it into your application: ```rust use anya_core::ml::agents::web5_agent::{ReadFirstDwnManager, CreateRecordOptions}; use std::sync::Arc; // Initialize the Web5 client and wrap it with ReadFirstDwnManager let web5_client = get_web5_client(); let manager = ReadFirstDwnManager::new(Arc::new(web5_client)); // Create a record (will automatically query similar records first) let record = manager.create_record(&CreateRecordOptions { data: serde_json::to_string(&data)?, schema: \"https://schema.org/TextDigitalDocument\".to_string(), data_format: \"application/json\".to_string(), })?; // Get metrics to verify Read First compliance let metrics = manager.get_metrics(); println!(\"Read count: {}\", metrics.read_count); println!(\"Write count: {}\", metrics.write_count); println!(\"Compliance rate: {}%\", metrics.compliance_rate()); ``` Testing Bitcoin Anchoring with Read First \u00b6 The Read First principle is particularly important when working with Bitcoin-anchored data. To test this integration: Create a Bitcoin-anchored credential with Read First enforcement: ```dart // Dart implementation final credential = await web5Service.createVerifiableCredential( subject: 'did:example:123', claims: {'name': 'Test User'}, bitcoinAnchoring: true, // Enable Bitcoin anchoring ); // Check Read First metrics to verify compliance final metrics = web5Service.getReadFirstMetrics(); ``` For the Rust implementation: ```rust // Rust implementation let credential = web5_manager.create_verifiable_credential( &subject_did, &claims, Some(BitcoinAnchoringOptions { enabled: true, confirmation_target: 1, }), )?; // Check Read First metrics to verify compliance let metrics = web5_manager.get_metrics(); ``` Verifying Metrics \u00b6 To verify the Read First principle is being enforced: Check that the read count is equal to or greater than the write count Verify that the compliance rate is 100% Confirm that the violation count is 0 Simulating Violations \u00b6 For testing purposes, you can simulate violations by directly using the underlying Web5 client: // This will NOT follow the Read First principle // Only use for testing, never in production code final web5Client = web5Service.getUnderlyingWeb5Client(); await web5Client.dwn.records.create(options); // Now check metrics to see the violation final metrics = web5Service.getReadFirstMetrics(); print('Violation count: ${metrics[\"violation_count\"]}'); Automated Testing in CI/CD \u00b6 The Read First principle tests are automatically run in CI/CD pipelines. To check the latest test results: Visit the GitHub Actions page for the repository Look for the \"Run Tests\" workflow Check the \"Test Read First Implementation\" job Reporting Issues \u00b6 If you encounter any issues with the Read First implementation, please report them on the GitHub issue tracker with the following information: Steps to reproduce the issue Expected behavior Actual behavior Metrics values (read count, write count, violation count) Any error messages or logs See Also \u00b6 Related Document 1 Related Document 2","title":"Testing_read_first"},{"location":"web5/TESTING_READ_FIRST/#testing-the-read-first-always-implementation","text":"","title":"Testing the Read First Always Implementation"},{"location":"web5/TESTING_READ_FIRST/#overview","text":"Add a brief overview of this document here.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"web5/TESTING_READ_FIRST/#table-of-contents","text":"Section 1 Section 2 This guide explains how to test the Read First Always principle implementation in both React and Rust components of the Anya Core project.","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"web5/TESTING_READ_FIRST/#prerequisites","text":"Make sure you have the following development tools installed: Dart SDK (2.19 or higher) Flutter (3.7 or higher) Rust (1.70 or higher) Cargo package manager Clone the repository and check out the feature branch: bash git clone https://github.com/Anya-org/OPSource.git cd OPSource git checkout feature/read-first-always-main","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"web5/TESTING_READ_FIRST/#testing-the-dart-implementation","text":"","title":"Testing the Dart Implementation"},{"location":"web5/TESTING_READ_FIRST/#running-the-unit-tests","text":"Navigate to the anya-core directory: bash cd anya-core Run the Dart tests specifically for the Read First implementation: bash flutter test test/web5/read_first_test.dart To run all tests including the Read First implementation: bash flutter test","title":"Running the Unit Tests"},{"location":"web5/TESTING_READ_FIRST/#manual-testing","text":"You can manually test the Read First implementation by integrating it into your application: ```dart import 'package:anya_core/src/core/web5/web5_service.dart'; // Initialize the Web5 service (automatically uses Read First) final web5Service = await Web5Service.connect(); // Create a record (will automatically read similar records first) await web5Service.createRecord( collection: 'notes', data: {'content': 'This is a test note'}, schema: 'https://schema.org/TextDigitalDocument', ); // Get metrics to verify Read First compliance final metrics = web5Service.getReadFirstMetrics(); print('Read count: ${metrics[\"read_count\"]}'); print('Write count: ${metrics[\"write_count\"]}'); print('Compliance rate: ${metrics[\"compliance_rate\"]}%'); ```","title":"Manual Testing"},{"location":"web5/TESTING_READ_FIRST/#testing-the-rust-implementation","text":"","title":"Testing the Rust Implementation"},{"location":"web5/TESTING_READ_FIRST/#running-the-unit-tests_1","text":"Navigate to the anya-core directory: bash cd anya-core Run the Rust tests specifically for the Web5 agent: bash cargo test --package anya-core --lib src/ml/agents/web5_agent To run all tests including the Web5 agent: bash cargo test","title":"Running the Unit Tests"},{"location":"web5/TESTING_READ_FIRST/#manual-testing_1","text":"You can manually test the Rust implementation by integrating it into your application: ```rust use anya_core::ml::agents::web5_agent::{ReadFirstDwnManager, CreateRecordOptions}; use std::sync::Arc; // Initialize the Web5 client and wrap it with ReadFirstDwnManager let web5_client = get_web5_client(); let manager = ReadFirstDwnManager::new(Arc::new(web5_client)); // Create a record (will automatically query similar records first) let record = manager.create_record(&CreateRecordOptions { data: serde_json::to_string(&data)?, schema: \"https://schema.org/TextDigitalDocument\".to_string(), data_format: \"application/json\".to_string(), })?; // Get metrics to verify Read First compliance let metrics = manager.get_metrics(); println!(\"Read count: {}\", metrics.read_count); println!(\"Write count: {}\", metrics.write_count); println!(\"Compliance rate: {}%\", metrics.compliance_rate()); ```","title":"Manual Testing"},{"location":"web5/TESTING_READ_FIRST/#testing-bitcoin-anchoring-with-read-first","text":"The Read First principle is particularly important when working with Bitcoin-anchored data.
