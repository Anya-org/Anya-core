## Model Serving

### Deployment Strategies

- **Canary Deployments**
  - Gradually roll out new model versions to a subset of users
  - Monitor performance metrics before full deployment
  - Easy rollback if issues are detected

- **Blue-Green Deployments**
  - Maintain two identical production environments
  - Switch traffic between environments for zero-downtime updates
  - Rollback by switching back to the previous environment

### Resource Management

- **Resource Allocation**
  - Set appropriate CPU/Memory limits for each model
  - Use GPU acceleration for compute-intensive models
  - Implement auto-scaling based on request load

- **Model Optimization**
  - Quantize models to reduce size and improve inference speed
  - Use model pruning to remove unnecessary parameters
  - Optimize batch sizes for your hardware

## Performance Optimization

### Caching

- **Response Caching**
  - Cache model inference results for identical inputs
  - Set appropriate TTL based on data freshness requirements
  - Invalidate cache when models are updated

### Batching

- **Request Batching**
  - Process multiple requests in a single batch
  - Balance between latency and throughput
  - Implement dynamic batching based on load

## Security

### Input Validation

- **Data Validation**
  - Validate all input data types and ranges
  - Implement input sanitization
  - Set maximum input size limits

### Model Security

- **Model Signing**
  - Digitally sign model files
  - Verify signatures before loading models
  - Maintain a registry of trusted model hashes

## Monitoring and Logging

### Metrics Collection

- **System Metrics**
  - CPU/Memory/GPU utilization
  - Request latency and throughput
  - Error rates and types

- **Model Metrics**
  - Prediction confidence scores
  - Input/output distributions
  - Drift detection metrics

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

- **Fallback Mechanisms**
  - Implement fallback to simpler models
  - Return cached results when possible
  - Provide meaningful error messages

### Retry Logic

- **Exponential Backoff**
  - Implement retries with exponential backoff
  - Set maximum retry limits
  - Log all retry attempts
