# Bitcoin Branch Merger Guide
[AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3]

## Overview

This guide outlines the process for merging all Bitcoin-related branches while preserving the hexagonal architecture structure and AIP upgrades.

## Branch Analysis

| Branch | Purpose | Key Features |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| feature/bitcoin-core | Core implementation | BIP-341, BIP-342, consensus rules |
| feature/bitcoin-hexagonal-architecture | Architecture structure | Hexagonal pattern, ports & adapters |
| feature/bitcoin-implementation | Implementation details | Protocol specifics, customizations |
| feature/bitcoin-layer2 | Layer 2 protocols | RGB, DLC, Lightning, RSK |
| feature/bitcoin-testing | Testing infrastructure | Unit tests, integration tests, benchmarks |
| feature/bitcoin-consolidated | Merged branch | Combined implementation with hexagonal structure |

## Merge Sequence

1. **Start with hexagonal architecture (already done)**
   - This branch provides the structural foundation
   - All ports and adapters follow proper hexagonal pattern
   - Interface definitions are clean and well-separated

2. **Add core implementation features**
   - Merge core components from feature/bitcoin-core
   - Ensure they fit into the hexagonal structure
   - Preserve all existing interfaces

3. **Add implementation details**
   - Merge implementation specifics from feature/bitcoin-implementation
   - Adapt any non-compliant code to fit hexagonal architecture

4. **Add Layer 2 protocols**
   - Merge all Layer 2 components from feature/bitcoin-layer2
   - Ensure they work through proper interfaces
   - Maintain separation of concerns

5. **Add testing infrastructure**
   - Merge testing components from feature/bitcoin-testing
   - Update tests to work with the hexagonal structure

## Resolution Strategies

### Structure Conflicts

When facing conflicts related to structure:
- **Always prefer** the hexagonal architecture structure
- Move implementation code to fit the architecture pattern
- Never compromise on interface boundaries

Example:
```
// HEXAGONAL (KEEP)
pub trait BlockchainPort {
    fn get_block(&self, hash: &BlockHash) -> Result<Block, Error>;
    // ...
}

// IMPLEMENTATION (ADAPT)
impl BlockchainPort for BitcoinNode {
    fn get_block(&self, hash: &BlockHash) -> Result<Block, Error> {
        // implementation code goes here
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Implementation Conflicts

When facing conflicts in implementation:
- Review both versions for functionality
- Prefer more recent/complete implementations
- Ensure they work through the proper interfaces

### Documentation Conflicts

When facing conflicts in documentation:
- Combine documentation from all sources
- Ensure it's up-to-date with the consolidated implementation
- Maintain AIP documentation standards

## Testing After Merge

After each component merge:
1. Ensure code compiles
2. Run unit tests for that component
3. Verify integration with existing components

## Final Validation

Before completing the consolidation:
1. Run the complete test suite
2. Verify all BIP implementations
3. Check compliance with Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5
4. Ensure all code follows [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3] labeling

## Troubleshooting

If merge conflicts become too complex:
1. Consider extracting the functionality separately
2. Implement from scratch following hexagonal architecture
3. Test thoroughly before integrating
