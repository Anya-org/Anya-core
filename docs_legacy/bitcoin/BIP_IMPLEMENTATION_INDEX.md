This document provides an index of all Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) implemented in the Anya-Core project, following the Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5.

## Implemented BIPs

| BIP | Title | Implementation | Test Coverage | Audit Status |

## Implementation Details

### BIP-341 (Taproot)

Implementation of the Taproot proposal, which introduces a new SegWit version 1 output type that can be spent using either a key path or by satisfying a script path.

**Features Implemented:**
- Taproot Merkle Tree construction
- Taproot spend validation
- Taproot output generation
- Key path spending
- Script path spending

**Location:** `core/src/bip/bip341.rs`

### BIP-342 (Tapscript)

Implementation of the Tapscript, which defines the semantics of the leaf version and the script execution context for spending Taproot outputs along the script path.

**Features Implemented:**
- Leaf version handling
- Tapscript execution
- Signature validation with specified rules
- Size limits and resource constraints

**Location:** `core/src/bip/bip342.rs`

### BIP-174 (PSBT)

Implementation of Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions, which provides a standard format for constructing unsigned transactions and enables multi-party signing workflows.

**Features Implemented:**
- Complete PSBT data structures (Global, Input, Output)
- PSBT validation and integrity checks
- Signature management and aggregation
- UTXO tracking (witness and non-witness)
- PSBT Builder pattern for easy construction
- Serialization/deserialization support
- Comprehensive error handling
- Support for both v1 and v2 PSBT formats

**Location:** `src/bitcoin/psbt.rs`

### Blockchain Metrics Enhancements

Added critical missing metrics as identified in AIR001:

**TPS (Transactions Per Second) Tracking:**
- Real-time TPS calculation and monitoring
- Historical TPS data with time series support
- Performance trend analysis

**Block Version Monitoring:**
- Track distribution of block versions across the network
- Detect protocol upgrade adoption
- Monitor for potential consensus issues

**51% Attack Detection:**
- Mining pool hashrate distribution tracking
- Automatic risk level assessment (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Real-time alerts for centralization risks
- Comprehensive attack risk reporting

**Location:** `src/monitoring/blockchain_metrics.rs`

## Implementation Priorities

The following BIPs are prioritized for upcoming implementation:

1. ✅ BIP-174 (PSBT) - Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions - **COMPLETED**
2. BIP-370 (PSBT v2) - Enhanced version of PSBT
3. BIP-340 (Schnorr Signatures) - Foundational for later enhancements

**Recently Completed (AIR001 Gap Analysis):**
- ✅ BIP-174 (PSBT) implementation with comprehensive feature set
- ✅ TPS (Transactions Per Second) metrics and monitoring
- ✅ Block version monitoring and distribution tracking  
- ✅ 51% attack detection with mining pool analysis
- ✅ Enhanced blockchain metrics with historical data support

## Compliance Requirements

All BIP implementations must:
- Pass the standard Bitcoin test vectors
- Follow the hexagonal architecture pattern
- Include comprehensive security checks
- Be thoroughly documented

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:** Direct validation of implementation against test vectors
2. **Integration Tests:** Interaction between multiple BIP implementations
3. **Security Tests:** Fuzz testing and edge case exploration
4. **Regression Tests:** Ensure compatibility with Bitcoin Core

## Audit Status

Regular security audits are conducted on all BIP implementations, with results documented in `security/audit/bip_audit_reports.md`.
