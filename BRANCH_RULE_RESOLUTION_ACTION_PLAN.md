# Branch Rule Resolution Action Plan

## Current Situation (June 23, 2025)

Your local repository has a `main` branch that is ahead of `origin/main` by 16 commits, including a merge commit that violates the repository rules. We need to properly integrate these changes while adhering to the project's branch protection rules.

## Analysis of Affected Branches

- **Local `main`**: Contains 16 commits ahead of `origin/main` including a problematic merge commit (b1123bc)
- **Remote `origin/main`**: Currently at 809c6a3, missing your local changes
- **Remote `origin/dev`**: At 4422a42, includes some of the changes in your local main
- **Current branch**: `branch-management-20250616` (d1888c0)

## Step-by-Step Resolution Plan

### 1. Capture Current Changes

First, let's ensure nothing is lost by creating a temporary branch with all your current work:

```bash
# Make sure we're on branch-management-20250616
git checkout branch-management-20250616

# Create a backup branch from local main
git checkout main
git checkout -b backup-main-20250623
git push origin backup-main-20250623
git checkout branch-management-20250616
```

### 2. Create a Clean Feature Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch from latest origin/main
git checkout -b feature/bitcoin-improvements origin/main

# Cherry-pick the important commits (excluding merge commits)
# Based on the commit history, we want to cherry-pick all the Bitcoin functionality improvements
git cherry-pick 290555d  # Bitcoin and identity integration example updates
git cherry-pick 2cb5c09  # Implement Default trait
git cherry-pick 8c254db  # Remove unused imports
git cherry-pick df56cda  # Correct syntax error
git cherry-pick 74ab416  # Add dead code annotations
git cherry-pick 6fbfba1  # Disable tests due to API changes
git cherry-pick 4d6dcc4  # Add visual system map and improve docs

# Now cherry-pick the dev container improvements
git cherry-pick 82e51d5  # Enhanced dev container setup
git cherry-pick 54eb03c  # Fix devcontainer image reference
git cherry-pick 6495db8  # Fix dev container configuration
git cherry-pick e9a263a  # Refactor devcontainer scripts
git cherry-pick 465a4e9  # Add automatic Rust crate dependency checks
```

### 3. Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push the new branch
git push origin feature/bitcoin-improvements

# Create PR in GitHub:
# Title: "Bitcoin functionality improvements and dev container enhancement"
# Description: "This PR includes Bitcoin functionality improvements, identity integration updates, and dev container enhancements. It replaces the previous direct push attempt that contained a merge commit."
```

### 4. Create a Second PR for Dev Container Changes (if needed for separation)

If you prefer to separate the changes for cleaner PRs:

```bash
# Create a separate branch for dev container improvements
git checkout origin/main -b feature/enhanced-dev-container

# Cherry-pick just the dev container commits
git cherry-pick 82e51d5 54eb03c 6495db8 e9a263a 465a4e9

git push origin feature/enhanced-dev-container
# Create second PR in GitHub
```

## Post-Resolution Steps

1. Work with code owners to get the PRs reviewed
2. Use the merge queue for all merges to main
3. Delete the local main branch and re-create it from origin/main after merges
4. Update your branch-management-20250616 branch as needed

## Verification Process

After merges are complete:

```bash
# Update local repository
git fetch --all

# Check that main is clean
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git log --oneline -n 10

# Verify all important changes are present
```

This action plan ensures that we adhere to the repository's rules while preserving all the valuable code changes. By creating clean PRs without merge commits, we can successfully get your changes integrated into the main branch.
