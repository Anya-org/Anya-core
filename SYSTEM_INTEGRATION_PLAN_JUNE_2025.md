### 1.3 Build System Improvements

| Task | Priority | Assigned | Due Date |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| Review and update dependency version constraints | Medium | TBD | June 24, 2025 |
| Address unused code warnings in installer components | Low | TBD | June 29, 2025 |
| Create unified build verification script | Medium | TBD | June 26, 2025 |

## 2. System Integration Strategy

### 2.1 API Consistency

To maintain API consistency across the system, all modules should follow these guidelines:

1. Provide both synchronous and asynchronous APIs for compatibility
2. Clearly document which API is recommended for new code
3. Use consistent naming patterns:
   - `fn method_name()` for synchronous methods
   - `async fn method_name()` for asynchronous methods
4. Place synchronous and asynchronous implementations in separate trait implementations
5. Use feature flags to control API availability when appropriate

### 2.2 Dependency Management

To improve dependency management:

1. Update root Cargo.toml with all shared dependencies
2. Use workspace inheritance for all member crates
3. Minimize direct dependency version specifications in member crates
4. Create a dependency update policy document
5. Document rationale for strict version pinning when needed

### 2.3 Feature Flag Integration

Ensure feature flags are consistently implemented:

1. Document all feature flags and their relationships
2. Test all feature flag combinations regularly
3. Use feature flags consistently across the workspace
4. Update CI to test various feature combinations

## 3. Module Locking Process

For each module that reaches stability, follow this locking process:

1. Complete all pending implementation tasks
2. Ensure test coverage is >90%
3. Create a module lock file documenting API, features, and stability status
4. Update system analysis document
5. Tag the locked module version in git

### 3.1 Module Locking Schedule

| Module | Current Status | Lock Date |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Layer2 Core Framework | Stable | ‚úÖ June 22, 2025 |
| BobClient | Stable | ‚úÖ June 22, 2025 |
| LiquidModule | Stable | ‚úÖ June 22, 2025 |
| RskClient | Stable | ‚úÖ June 22, 2025 |
| StacksClient | Stable | ‚úÖ June 22, 2025 |
| TaprootAssetsProtocol | Stable | ‚úÖ June 22, 2025 |
| LightningNetwork | Stable | ‚úÖ June 22, 2025 |
| StateChannel | Stable | ‚úÖ June 22, 2025 |
| Layer2Manager | Stable | ‚úÖ June 22, 2025 |

### 3.2 Next Steps After Locking

With all Layer2 modules now locked, focus will shift to:

1. **Documentation Updates (High Priority)**
   - Update API documentation for async implementations
   - Create migration guide for sync to async transition
   - Update system architecture diagrams
   - Create stakeholder-facing visualizations of performance gains

2. **Test Issue Resolution (High Priority)**
   - Address RGB asset test failures
   - Fix DAO business agent test failures

3. **System Integration Acceleration**
   - Revisit timelines for remaining components
   - Consider early locking of additional components if tests pass
   - Re-prioritize resources to focus on RGB and DAO components

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyze memory usage increase (29.5%) to identify optimization opportunities
   - Review connection pooling and resource management in async implementations
   - Document best practices for production deployments
