## Post-Install Validation

1. Verify BIP compliance:

   ```bash
   anya-core validate-install --bip=341,174,370
   ```

2. Test security controls:

   ```bash
   anya-core security-test --memory --crypto --timing
   ```

3. Check system integration:

   ```bash
   anya-core check-integration bitcoin-core
   anya-core check-integration web5-dwn
   ```

### Detailed Validation Steps

For a comprehensive post-installation validation, follow these steps:

1. **BIP Compliance Validation**:
   Run the BIP validation tool to ensure compliance with Bitcoin protocol standards:

   ```bash
   anya-core validate-install --bip=341,342,174
   ```

   **Expected Result**: Should report "BIP-341: Fully Compliant", "BIP-174: Fully Compliant", "BIP-342: Partially Compliant" (or Fully Compliant if BIP-342 is fully implemented), and "BIP-370: Pending" (or status based on implementation).

2. **Security Controls Testing**:
   Execute security tests to validate cryptographic safety, memory management, and timing attack resistance:

   ```bash
   anya-core security-test --memory --crypto --timing --level=bpc3
   ```

   **Expected Result**: All security tests should pass at BPC-3 level, indicating no critical vulnerabilities related to RNG, constant-time operations, or insecure algorithms.

3. **System Integration Checks**:
   Verify integration with external components like Bitcoin Core and Web5 Decentralized Web Node (DWN):

   ```bash
   anya-core check-integration bitcoin-core
   anya-core check-integration web5-dwn
   ```

   **Expected Result**: Integration checks should confirm successful connection and data exchange with Bitcoin Core and Web5 DWN.

4. **File Integrity Verification**:
   Validate the integrity of installed files using cryptographic hashes:

   ```bash
   anya-core verify-files --manifest=install_manifest.json
   ```

   **Expected Result**: File integrity verification should pass, confirming that no files have been corrupted or tampered with during installation.

5. **Full Security Audit Report**:
   Generate a comprehensive security audit report for detailed analysis:

   ```bash
   anya-core security-report --full --output install_audit_report.md
   ```

   **Expected Result**: The security audit report should provide a detailed breakdown of all security checks, compliance status, and any remaining issues, allowing for thorough review and follow-up actions.
