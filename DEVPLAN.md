# Anya Core Project Development Plan

## Current Status

- Basic project structure implemented
- User management system in place
- STX, DLC, Lightning, and Bitcoin support integrated
- Kademlia-based network discovery implemented
- Federated learning module added
- Basic CLI and testing infrastructure set up

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Architecture and Networking (Current Sprint)

1. Implement modular, plugin-based architecture
2. Apply Hexagonal Architecture pattern
3. Implement standardized API layer (OpenAPI 3.0)
4. Develop internal metrics and function awareness system
5. Fully implement libp2p for P2P communications
6. Enhance Kademlia DHT implementation
7. Integrate IPFS support

### Phase 2: Blockchain and Identity

1. Enhance Bitcoin, Lightning, Stacks, and DLC support
2. Implement cross-chain metrics and monitoring
3. Implement DIDs and Verifiable Credentials
4. Integrate WebAuthn for secure authentication

### Phase 3: Data Management and Smart Contracts

1. Integrate OrbitDB for peer-to-peer databases
2. Implement IPLD for data representation
3. Enhance Clarity smart contract support
4. Integrate WebAssembly for smart contract execution

### Phase 4: Advanced Features and Optimization

1. Enhance Federated Learning implementation
2. Implement privacy features (zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption)
3. Develop web and mobile user interfaces
4. Implement internal optimization and self-awareness systems

### Phase 5: Interoperability and Future Development

1. Implement IBC protocol for cross-chain interactions
2. Integrate Cosmos SDK and Polkadot's XCMP
3. Develop advanced AI features and self-evolving capabilities
4. Implement continuous self-analysis and optimization

## Current Sprint: Phase 1 (Estimated: 4 weeks)

- [ ] Task 1: Set up modular architecture
- [ ] Task 2: Implement Hexagonal Architecture pattern
- [ ] Task 3: Create OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
- [ ] Task 4: Develop basic metrics system
- [ ] Task 5: Integrate libp2p for P2P communications
- [ ] Task 6: Enhance Kademlia DHT implementation
- [ ] Task 7: Integrate IPFS support

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 1 tasks
2. Review and adjust development plan
3. Begin Phase 2 implementation

## Long-term Goals

- Achieve full production readiness
- Implement self-improving AI capabilities
- Establish a robust open-source community
- Continuous security auditing and compliance checks

## Transition to Roadmap

Once the rewrite is complete, this DEVPLAN.md and the separate Rewriteplan.md will be deprecated. A new Roadmap.md file will be created to replace both, ensuring synchronicity and alignment for future development efforts.
