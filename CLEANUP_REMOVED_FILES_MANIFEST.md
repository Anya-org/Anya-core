## Verification

After removal, verify:

```bash
# Verify files are actually removed
for file in "${REMOVED_FILES[@]}"; do
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: $file still exists"
  fi
done

# Verify functionality is preserved
./scripts/quality_gate.sh --full
./scripts/validate_canonical_compliance.sh validate
```
