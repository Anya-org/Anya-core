- Federated learning module added
- Basic CLI and testing infrastructure set up

## Rewrite to Open Standards

### 1. Architecture

- Implement a modular, plugin-based architecture for easy extension and customization
- Use the Rust-based Hexagonal Architecture pattern for better separation of concerns
- Implement a standardized API layer using OpenAPI 3.0 specifications

### 2. Networking and P2P

- Fully implement libp2p for all peer-to-peer communications (partially implemented)
- Use the Noise Protocol Framework for end-to-end encryption
- Enhance Kademlia DHT implementation for peer discovery and routing
- Support IPFS for decentralized content addressing and distribution

### 3. Blockchain Integrations

- Enhance Bitcoin support using the Bitcoin Core RPC interface
- Improve Lightning Network integration using the LND gRPC API
- Enhance Stacks blockchain support using the Stacks blockchain API
- Improve DLC support using the latest Rust DLC library

### 4. Federated Learning

- Enhance the Federated Learning implementation based on the OpenFL framework
- Implement differential privacy techniques using the OpenDP library
- Implement secure aggregation using the SPDZ protocol

### 5. Identity and Authentication

- Implement decentralized identifiers (DIDs) using the W3C DID specification
- Use Verifiable Credentials for user authentication and authorization
- Implement the Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standard for secure authentication

### 6. Data Storage and Management

- Integrate IPFS for decentralized data storage
- Implement OrbitDB for peer-to-peer databases
- Use the InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD) format for data representation

### 7. Smart Contracts and Programmability

- Enhance support for Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain
- Integrate WebAssembly (Wasm) for portable, efficient smart contract execution
- Implement the InterPlanetary Actor System (IPAS) for distributed computation

### 8. Interoperability

- Implement the InterBlockchain Communication (IBC) protocol for cross-chain interactions
- Integrate Cosmos SDK for building application-specific blockchains
- Implement Polkadot's XCMP (Cross-Chain Message Passing) for parachain communication

### 9. Privacy and Security

- Implement zero-knowledge proofs using the bulletproofs library
- Integrate homomorphic encryption techniques from the SEAL library
- Implement secure multi-party computation (MPC) using the MP-SPDZ framework

### 10. User Interface

- Develop a web-based interface using WebAssembly and the Yew framework
- Enhance CLI implementation using the clap crate for Rust
- Develop mobile applications using React Native with Rust bindings
