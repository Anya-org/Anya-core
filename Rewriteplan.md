## Future Plans

1. Enhance federated learning capabilities with self-improving algorithms
2. Implement adaptive network discovery and peer-to-peer communication
3. Expand blockchain integrations with automatic performance comparisons
4. Enhance security measures with AI-driven threat detection
5. Improve user interface with personalized, adaptive experiences
6. Implement advanced AI features with self-evolving capabilities
7. Optimize performance and scalability through continuous self-analysis
8. Expand developer tools with auto-generated, context-aware documentation

## Ongoing Tasks

- Continuous integration, testing, and self-improvement
- AI-driven security audits and automatic updates
- Community engagement and open-source contribution management
- Adaptive compliance with relevant standards and regulations
- Continuous benchmarking and self-optimizing performance tuning

## Transition to Roadmap

Once the rewrite is complete, this Rewriteplan.md and the separate DEVPLAN.md will be deprecated. A new Roadmap.md file will be created to replace both, ensuring synchronicity and alignment for future development efforts.
