# Commit Label Corrections

## Overview

This document provides corrected AI labels for commits that did not follow the standardized AI_LABELING.md v3.1 format.

## Corrected Labels

### Commit 54d981b - fix(tests): fix Layer2 integration test compilation errors

**Original Labels:** `[FIX] [TESTING] [INTEGRATION]` (Non-standard format)

**Corrected Labels:** `[AIR-2][AIS-2][AIT-3][BPC-2][RES-1]`

**Rationale:**

- AIR-2: Enhanced AI-Readiness (structured test interfaces)
- AIS-2: Enhanced AI Security (input/output validation in tests)
- AIT-3: Advanced AI Testing (comprehensive testing including Layer2 protocols)
- BPC-2: Enhanced Bitcoin Compliance (advanced Bitcoin features testing)
- RES-1: Basic Resilience (basic error handling and recovery in tests)

### Commit 9baa2de - feat(testing): add comprehensive Layer2 integration tests and audit framework

**Original Labels:** `[FEAT] [TESTING] [SECURITY] [PERFORMANCE]` (Non-standard format)

**Corrected Labels:** `[AIR-3][AIS-3][AIT-3][BPC-3][PFM-3][RES-3]`

**Rationale:**

- AIR-3: Full AI-Readiness (comprehensive interfaces for testing and audit)
- AIS-3: Advanced AI Security (comprehensive validation, threat modeling, testing)
- AIT-3: Advanced AI Testing (comprehensive testing including adversarial testing)
- BPC-3: Advanced Bitcoin Compliance (complete compliance with relevant BIPs)
- PFM-3: Advanced Performance (advanced optimizations, continuous monitoring)
- RES-3: Advanced Resilience (advanced resilience, self-healing capabilities)

## Label Validation

These corrected labels have been validated against:

- AI_LABELING.md v3.1 specification
- COMMIT_RULES.md requirements
- Component-specific labeling requirements

## Implementation

Since these commits are already in the remote repository and have been referenced by subsequent commits, we maintain the original commits but document the proper labels here for future reference and compliance tracking.

## Future Compliance

All future commits must use the standardized AI labeling format as defined in AI_LABELING.md v3.1.
