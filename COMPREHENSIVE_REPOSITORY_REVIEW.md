- **Result type errors** in trait implementations

**Recommendation:** Schedule dedicated compilation cleanup sprint

#### 2. **Dependency Updates (Low Priority)**  
Two unmaintained Rust crates identified:
- `instant` (0.1.13) - RUSTSEC-2024-0384
- `proc-macro-error` (1.0.4) - RUSTSEC-2024-0370

**Recommendation:** Replace with maintained alternatives
