# Layer2 Protocol Implementation Status

## Protocol Client Default Trait Implementation

| Protocol | Default Trait | Initialized in Manager | Status |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|--------|
| BobClient | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Added | Working |
| LiquidModule | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Added | Working |
| RskClient | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Added | Working |
| StacksClient | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Added | Working |
| TaprootAssetsProtocol | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Added | Working |
| LightningNetwork | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Added | Working |
| StateChannel | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Added | Working |

## Remaining Issues

- Test failures in certain modules (rgb_asset_test.rs and dao tests) are unrelated to Layer2 protocol implementations
- `cargo check` passes without any errors related to Layer2 protocol implementations
- All Layer2 protocol clients now properly implement the Default trait
- Layer2Manager has been modified to initialize all protocols without borrow checker errors

## Summary of Changes

1. Confirmed Default implementations for:
   - BobClient
   - LiquidModule
   - RskClient
   - StacksClient
   - TaprootAssetsProtocol
   - LightningNetwork
   - StateChannel

2. Fixed Layer2Manager to prevent borrow checker errors during protocol initialization by:
   - Replacing the generic `init_protocol<T>` method with specific initialization blocks
   - Ensuring each protocol is initialized with proper Default implementations
   - Adding initialization for Lightning and State Channels protocols

3. Confirmed that all Struct and Default implementations are properly aligned and no duplicate implementations exist

## Next Steps

1. Address test failures in unrelated modules
2. Add additional test coverage for Layer2 protocol implementations
3. Consider implementing the async Layer2Protocol trait for all protocol clients
