## Overview

The Machine Learning (ML) module provides advanced ML capabilities for the Anya Core system, including model management, training, prediction, and federated learning. This module is designed to support various Bitcoin-related ML applications, such as transaction analysis, anomaly detection, and security enhancement.

## Core Components

### MLSystem

The central coordinator for all ML functionality in Anya Core.

#### Key Features

- Model registration and management
- Service health monitoring
- ML configuration handling

#### Usage Example

```rust
let config = MLConfig::default();
let mut ml_system = MLSystem::new(config).await?;
let metrics = ml_system.get_health_metrics().await;
```

### MLService

The production-grade ML service that handles model loading, inference, and management.

#### Key Features

- Model loading and unloading
- Inference execution
- Performance metrics collection

### RealMLEngine

The core inference engine that powers the ML service.

#### Key Features

- Direct model interaction
- Efficient inference processing
- Support for various model types

## Specialized Modules

### Agent System

The `agent_system` module provides an agent-based architecture for autonomous ML operations.

#### Key Components

- `MLAgentSystem`: Coordinates agents for specific ML tasks

### ML Adapters

The `adapters` module provides integration with external ML frameworks.

#### Key Components

- `MLModelAdapter`: Interface for adapting external models
- `AdapterFactory`: Creates adapters for different frameworks
- `MLAdapterRegistry`: Registry of available adapters

### Tools Framework

The `tools` module provides a framework for ML-powered tools.

#### Key Components

- `Tool`: Interface for ML-powered tools
- `ToolRegistry`: Registry of available tools
- `ToolManager`: Management of tool execution

### Planning and Reasoning

The `planning` module provides planning and reasoning capabilities.

#### Key Components

- `Planner`: Creates execution plans
- `Reasoner`: Performs logical reasoning
- `PlanningEngine`: Coordinates planning and execution

### Orchestration

The `orchestration` module provides workflow orchestration.

#### Key Components

- `WorkflowBuilder`: Creates ML workflows
- `WorkflowDefinition`: Defines workflow structure
- `WorkflowEngine`: Executes workflows

## Configuration

The ML module can be configured using the `MLConfig` struct:

```rust
let config = MLConfig {
    enabled: true,
    model_path: Some("./data/models".to_string()),
    use_gpu: true,
    federated_learning: true,
    max_model_size: 100 * 1024 * 1024, // 100 MB
};
```

## Federated Learning

The ML module supports federated learning, allowing models to be trained across multiple nodes while preserving data privacy.

#### Key Components

- `FederatedNode`: Represents a node in the federated learning network
- `FederatedLearningManager`: Coordinates federated learning operations

## Data Structures

### Input and Output

- `MLInput`: Standardized input format for ML models
- `MLOutput`: Standardized output format from ML models
- `InferenceRequest`: Request format for inference operations
- `InferenceResponse`: Response format from inference operations

## Performance and Metrics

The ML module provides comprehensive metrics for monitoring:

- Service-level metrics (total inferences, success/failure rates)
- Model-specific metrics (accuracy, latency, resource usage)
- Health metrics for the overall system
