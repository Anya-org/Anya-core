## Overview

The DAO module enables on-chain governance and decision-making for Anya Core, allowing stakeholders to participate in the management and evolution of the system through voting and proposal mechanisms.

## Components

The DAO module consists of several key components:

- **Governance**: Proposal creation, management, and execution
- **Voting**: Secure voting mechanisms with verification
- **Legal**: Legal framework templates and compliance tools
- **Compatibility**: Integration with different blockchain governance systems

## Governance

The governance system provides a structured approach to decision-making:

```rust
// Create a new governance proposal
let proposal = DaoGovernance::create_proposal(
    "Treasury allocation for development",
    "Allocate 1000 tokens for Q3 development",
    ProposalCategory::Treasury
);

// Set parameters for voting
proposal.set_voting_period(7); // 7 days
proposal.set_quorum(0.51); // 51% required
```

## Voting

The voting system ensures secure and verifiable voting:

```rust
// Cast a vote
let vote = Vote::new(
    proposal_id,
    VoteChoice::Approve,
    voting_power
);

// Submit the vote
dao.submit_vote(vote, signature)?;

// Check proposal status
let status = dao.get_proposal_status(proposal_id);
```

## Compatibility

The DAO module includes compatibility layers with various blockchain governance systems:

- Clarity compatibility for Stacks integration
- Ethereum-compatible governance
- Bitcoin script-based voting verification

## Examples

Example of creating and executing a governance proposal:

```rust
// Initialize DAO
let dao = DaoGovernance::new(DaoLevel::Organization);

// Create proposal
let proposal_id = dao.create_proposal(
    "System upgrade",
    "Upgrade to version 1.4.0",
    ProposalCategory::SystemUpgrade
)?;

// Voting period...

// Execute approved proposal
if dao.get_proposal_status(proposal_id) == ProposalStatus::Approved {
    dao.execute_proposal(proposal_id)?;
}
```
