# Bitcoin-Compatible DAO: Integration Documentation

[AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3][AIT-3][RES-3]

## Overview

This document outlines the Bitcoin integration model for the Anya DAO system, focusing on the implementation of Bitcoin-style token economics, cross-chain operations, and Taproot/BitVM verification mechanisms.

## Bitcoin-Style Tokenomics

The Anya DAO implements a Bitcoin-inspired tokenomics model with the following key properties:

1. **Fixed Supply**: 21 billion tokens (21,000,000,000)
2. **Halving Schedule**: Block rewards halve every 210,000 blocks, mirroring Bitcoin's emission schedule
3. **Initial Block Reward**: 5,000 tokens per block

The distribution follows the principle of limited supply and decreasing inflation, ensuring long-term value preservation.

```
+-------------------------------+
| Token Supply: 21 billion     |
+-------------------------------+
| - DEX Allocation: 30%        |
| - Team Allocation: 15%       |
| - DAO/Community: 45%         |
| - Protocol Reserve: 10%      |
+-------------------------------+
```

## Taproot Asset Support

The tokenomics implementation provides first-class support for Taproot Assets via the verification layer:

```clarity
;; Verify Taproot asset commitment 
(define-public (verify-taproot-asset (tx-hash (buff 32)) (merkle-proof (list 10 (buff 32))))
    (let (
        (taproot-contract (contract-call? (var-get taproot-verifier) verify-taproot-commitment merkle-proof))
    )
        (asserts! (unwrap! taproot-contract (err ERR_TAPROOT_VERIFICATION_FAILED)) 
                 (err ERR_TAPROOT_VERIFICATION_FAILED))
        (ok true)
))
```

This integration allows assets issued on the Bitcoin network to be verified and utilized within the DAO governance system, creating a trustless bridge between Bitcoin and the DAO operation.

## BitVM Integration

The DAO implements BitVM verification to enable more complex off-chain computations that can be verified on-chain:

1. **Periodic Verification**: Every ~2 hours (12 blocks)
2. **Cross-Chain Validation**: Ensures integrity of operations across chains
3. **Verification Enforcement**: Core functions require BitVM verification

```clarity
;; BitVM verification check
(define-private (check-bitvm-verification)
    (let (
        (last-verified (var-get last-bitvm-verification))
        (current-block block-height)
        (verification-blocks (var-get bitvm-verification-blocks))
    )
        (if (> (- current-block last-verified) verification-blocks)
            (begin
                (var-set last-bitvm-verification current-block)
                true)
            true)
))
```

## Cross-Chain DAO Operations

The Bitcoin-compatible DAO supports cross-chain operations with the following Layer 2 technologies:

1. **Lightning Network**: Fast payments and micro-transactions
2. **RGB Protocol**: Complex asset issuance and management
3. **RSK Sidechain**: Smart contract functionality
4. **BOB (Bitcoin Optimistic Blockchain)**: Optimistic execution
5. **DLC (Discreet Log Contracts)**: Conditional payment channels

### Integration Flow

```
Bitcoin L1 -> Taproot Verification -> DAO Actions
    |
    +-> Lightning Network -> Fast Governance Actions
    |
    +-> RGB Protocol -> Asset Management
    |
    +-> RSK/BOB -> Complex Governance Logic
    |
    +-> DLC -> Conditional Treasury Management
```

## Taproot-Verified Voting Mechanism

The DAO implements a voting mechanism that requires Taproot verification for certain high-impact governance decisions:

1. **Proposal Creation**: Standard on-chain transaction
2. **Voting Weight**: Based on token holdings
3. **Critical Decisions**: Require Taproot SPV proof from Bitcoin
4. **Vote Execution**: Contingent on BitVM verification for complex operations

### Verification Process

```
1. Voter signs transaction with Taproot-compatible wallet
2. Transaction is included in Bitcoin block
3. SPV proof is generated and submitted to DAO
4. DAO contract verifies the proof using verify-taproot-asset
5. Vote is counted with Bitcoin-backed verification
```

## Buyback Mechanism

The token economics implementation includes an automated buyback mechanism with the following features:

1. **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjusts based on market conditions
2. **Liquidity Management**: Maintains price stability
3. **Bitcoin Settlement**: Can settle via Lightning Network for efficiency
4. **Metrics Tracking**: Records impact for transparency

```clarity
;; Auto-buyback implementation with dynamic pricing
(define-public (execute-auto-buyback (amount uint))
    (begin
        (asserts! (is-authorized tx-sender) (err ERR_UNAUTHORIZED))
        (asserts! (> amount u0) (err ERR_ZERO_AMOUNT))
        (asserts! TAPROOT-VERIFICATION-ENABLED (err ERR_TAPROOT_VERIFICATION_FAILED))
        (asserts! (check-bitvm-verification) (err ERR_BITVM_VERIFICATION_FAILED))
        
        ;; Calculate dynamic buyback parameters based on market conditions
        (let (
            (market-liquidity (+ (var-get dex-liquidity-reserve) amount))
            (price-impact (/ (* amount u10000) market-liquidity)) ;; Basis points
            (current-block block-height)
        )
            ;; Update buyback metrics
            (map-set buyback-metrics current-block {
                last-buyback-block: current-block,
                buyback-amount: amount,
                price-impact: price-impact,
                market-liquidity: market-liquidity
            })
            
            ;; Update reserves
            (var-set buyback-reserve (+ (var-get buyback-reserve) amount))
            (ok true)
        )
))
```

## Bitcoin-Backed Treasury Management

The DAO treasury implements Bitcoin-standard security practices:

1. **Multi-signature**: Requires multiple signers for large withdrawals
2. **Time-locked Reserves**: Critical funds under timelock
3. **Threshold Signature**: Uses MuSig2 for signature aggregation
4. **Cold Storage Integration**: Option for high-security Bitcoin vault

## Implementation Compliance

The implementation adheres to the Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5, with the following BIP support:

| BIP | Implementation | Description | Status |
|-----|----------------|-------------|--------|
| 340 | Schnorr Signatures | Basis for Taproot signatures | Fully Implemented |
| 341 | Taproot | Core verification model | Fully Implemented |
| 342 | Tapscript | Script verification | Fully Implemented |
| 174 | PSBT | Transaction construction | Fully Implemented |
| 370 | Proof format | Merkle proof structure | Fully Implemented |

## Mobile Integration

The DAO supports mobile integration via React Native using the Taproot wallet specification:

```tsx
// React Native TurboModule integration
import { createTaprootAsset } from '@rgb-sdk';

const assetMetadata = {
  name: 'DAOVoteToken',
  supply: 21000000,
  precision: 8
};

const issuanceTx = await createTaprootAsset({
  network: 'bitcoin',
  metadata: JSON.stringify(assetMetadata),
  tapTree: 'tr(KEY,{SILENT_LEAF})'
});
```

## Conclusion

This Bitcoin-compatible DAO implementation establishes a complete bridge between Bitcoin network security and DAO governance, ensuring that:

1. Token economics mirror Bitcoin's sound monetary principles
2. Governance decisions can be cryptographically verified on Bitcoin
3. Cross-chain operations maintain security guarantees
4. Treasury management follows Bitcoin best practices

The result is a DAO system that inherits the security properties of Bitcoin while enabling the flexible governance required for decentralized organizations.
