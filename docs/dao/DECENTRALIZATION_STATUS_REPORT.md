## Outstanding Tasks

### 1. Contract Integration

- Update any remaining DAO contracts to use multi-signature governance.
- Complete integration tests for all modified contracts.

### 2. Bridge Automation

- Create redundant, automated bridge mechanisms for cross-chain operations.
- Implement decentralized schedulers for bridge tasks.

### 4. Economic Parameter Calibration

- Fine-tune staking requirements and rewards for economic security.
- Simulate economic models to validate incentive alignment.

### 5. Testing Infrastructure

- Complete integration testing across all contracts.
- Build automated test suite for continuous validation.

### 6. Migration Strategy

- Develop a detailed plan for migrating from current centralized model.
- Create safety mechanisms for the transition period.

## JavaScript Utility Refactoring Status

### Completed

- Created contract interface definitions based on new traits.

### Outstanding

- Unified configuration management module.
- Shared blockchain interaction utilities.
- Standardized logging and error handling.

## Documentation Consolidation Status

### Completed

- Created comprehensive architecture documentation.
- Established cross-references between implementation documents.
- Created unified JavaScript utilities with consistent documentation.

### Outstanding

- Further consolidation of duplicate content.
- Enhanced clear separation between conceptual, technical, and user documentation.

## Security Considerations

### Completed Security Measures

- âœ… Multi-signature threshold prevents single point of failure
- âœ… Timelock periods allow community to react to malicious proposals
- âœ… Economic security through staking requirements for oracle operators
- âœ… Threshold signatures prevent oracle manipulation
- âœ… Transparent on-chain activity for community oversight

### Pending Security Enhancements

- â¬œ Formal verification of core contracts planned for Q4 2025
- â¬œ External security audit planned for Q3 2025
- â¬œ Incentivized bug bounty program planned for Q3 2025

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Side-by-Side Operation (Completed)

- âœ… New decentralized contracts deployed alongside existing contracts
- âœ… Documentation and tooling updated to support both systems

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration (In Progress)

- ðŸŸ¨ Moving funds to new treasury management system
- ðŸŸ¨ Community education about new governance processes
- ðŸŸ¨ Initial oracle operator onboarding

### Phase 3: Full Transition (Planned: Q4 2025)

- â¬œ Complete transition to new governance system
- â¬œ Deprecation of centralized contracts
- â¬œ Full activation of all decentralized features

## Recommendations

1. **Parameter Tuning**: Fine-tune governance parameters based on initial deployment data.
2. **Oracle Network Expansion**: Gradually expand the oracle network with vetted operators.
3. **Economic Validation**: Continue economic simulations to validate incentive models.
4. **Security Audit**: Conduct comprehensive security audit before full migration.
5. **Community Governance Training**: Develop educational materials for community governance participation.
6. **Technical Workshops**: Conduct workshops for oracle operators and developers.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the integration of multi-signature governance across remaining contracts (reporting-system, etc.).
2. Expand and enhance test coverage for all new contracts.
3. Begin security audit preparations.
4. Continue community education about new governance mechanisms.

## Timeline

| Phase | Description | Estimated Duration |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Integration of multi-signature governance | 2 weeks |
| 2 | Oracle network refinement | 3 weeks |
| 3 | Bridge automation | 2 weeks |
| 4 | JavaScript utility refactoring | 2 weeks |
| 5 | Documentation consolidation | 1 week |
| 6 | Testing and validation | 2 weeks |
| 7 | Migration planning | 1 week |

Total estimated time to complete full decentralization: **13 weeks**

## Conclusion

The Anya-core DAO decentralization effort has made significant progress with the creation of foundational contracts and architecture. The implementation of multi-signature governance, decentralized oracles, and claim-based rewards represents a substantial step toward full decentralization. The remaining work focuses primarily on integration, refinement, and ecosystem development rather than core architectural changes.

By following the phased approach outlined above, the DAO can transition safely to a fully decentralized model while maintaining operational continuity and security.
