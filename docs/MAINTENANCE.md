- Document any changes made to dependencies in future updates.

## Maintenance Best Practices

1. Run regular dependency audits with `cargo audit`.
2. Update documentation with each significant code change.
3. Create checkpoints after significant development milestones.
4. Maintain consistent AI labeling across commits.
5. Follow the `rust-bitcoin` community standards for Bitcoin-related code.
6. Regularly test Web5 integration components.
7. Review and clean up temporary files quarterly.

### Markdown Issues Resolved
