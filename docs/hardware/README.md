# Hardware Module

[Compliance: [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3][RES-3]]

## Overview

This module provides hardware analysis and system information capabilities for the Anya Core system. It enables runtime detection of system capabilities, resource monitoring, and hardware optimization. The module is source-aligned with `/src/hardware/analyzer.rs`.

## Core Components

### HardwareAnalyzer

The main hardware analysis system that provides comprehensive system information and resource monitoring capabilities.

#### Features

- CPU core detection and analysis
- Memory capacity and utilization monitoring
- System resource assessment
- Hardware capability detection
- Performance optimization recommendations

#### Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::hardware::HardwareAnalyzer;
use std::error::Error;

fn analyze_system_hardware() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let analyzer = HardwareAnalyzer::new()?;

    // Get CPU information
    let cpu_cores = analyzer.cpu_cores()?;
    println!("CPU Cores: {}", cpu_cores);

    // Get memory information
    let memory_gb = analyzer.memory_gb()?;
    println!("Total Memory: {} GB", memory_gb);

    // Use information for system optimization
    if cpu_cores >= 8 && memory_gb >= 16 {
        println!("System suitable for high-performance operations");
    }

    Ok(())
}
```
