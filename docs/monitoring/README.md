# Monitoring Module

[Compliance: [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3][RES-3]]

## Overview

This module provides comprehensive monitoring and metrics collection capabilities for the Anya Core system. It includes network health monitoring, fee tracking, and system performance metrics aligned with `/src/monitoring/mod.rs`.

## Core Components

### MonitoringSystem

The main monitoring system that coordinates metric collection, storage, and retrieval across all system components.

#### Features

- Real-time metric updates and collection
- Configurable metric registry system
- Network health status monitoring
- Fee and transaction monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking

#### Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::monitoring::{MonitoringSystem, Registry, NetworkMetric, FeeMetric};

fn setup_monitoring() -> Result<(), String> {
    let monitoring = MonitoringSystem::new();
    let registry = Registry::new();

    // Update system metrics
    monitoring.update_metric("network_latency", 45.2)?;
    monitoring.update_metric("transaction_throughput", 1250.0)?;

    // Retrieve current metrics
    let metrics = monitoring.get_metrics();

    // Setup network monitoring
    let network_metric = NetworkMetric::new(&registry);
    network_metric.update(98.5);
    println!("Network Status: {}", network_metric.description());

    Ok(())
}
```

### Registry

Metric registration and management system that maintains references to all active metrics.

### NetworkMetric

Specialized metric for tracking network health, connectivity, and performance indicators.

#### Properties

- Real-time network status updates
- Connection quality measurements
- Latency and throughput tracking
- Health status descriptions

### FeeMetric

Specialized metric for monitoring transaction fees and economic indicators within the system.

## Integration Points

- `/src/monitoring/mod.rs`: Main monitoring implementation
- **Performance Module**: For system performance metrics
- **Network Module**: For network connectivity monitoring
- **DAO Module**: For governance and economic metrics
- **Dashboard Module**: For metrics visualization

## Monitoring Categories

### System Health

- CPU and memory utilization
- Disk space and I/O metrics
- Network connectivity status
- Service availability monitoring

### Network Metrics

- Transaction throughput
- Network latency measurements
- Peer connection status
- Block synchronization metrics

### Economic Metrics

- Transaction fee tracking
- Token economics monitoring
- Reward distribution metrics
- Market performance indicators

### Security Metrics

- Authentication success rates
- Failed access attempts
- Security event monitoring
- Compliance status tracking

## Compliance Standards

### AIR-3 (Audit, Integrity, and Reliability)

Ensures monitoring data integrity and reliable metric collection with audit trails for all system measurements.

### AIS-3 (Alignment, Integration, and Security)

Provides secure integration with all system components while maintaining data alignment across monitoring systems.

### BPC-3 (Bitcoin Protocol Compliance)

Monitors Bitcoin protocol compliance metrics and ensures adherence to network standards and BIP implementations.

### RES-3 (Resilience and Error Handling)

Implements resilient monitoring with error handling, metric validation, and system recovery capabilities.

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Advanced alerting and notification systems
- Historical trend analysis and forecasting
- Integration with external monitoring tools

## Maintainers

- Core team, infrastructure architects
