# Compliance Standards Documentation

This directory contains information about the compliance standards used throughout the Anya Core project.

## Available Standards

### AIR - Availability & Integrity Requirements

- **AIR-1**: Basic availability and integrity requirements
- **AIR-2**: Enhanced availability and integrity requirements
- **AIR-3**: High availability and integrity requirements

### AIS - Application Integration Standards

- **AIS-1**: Basic application integration
- **AIS-2**: Enhanced application integration
- **AIS-3**: Comprehensive application integration

### BPC - Bitcoin Protocol Compatibility

- **BPC-1**: Basic Bitcoin protocol compatibility
- **BPC-2**: Enhanced Bitcoin protocol compatibility
- **BPC-3**: Comprehensive Bitcoin protocol compatibility

### RES - Resource Efficiency Standards

- **RES-1**: Basic resource efficiency
- **RES-2**: Enhanced resource efficiency
- **RES-3**: Optimized resource efficiency

## Compliance Tags

Compliance tags are used throughout the codebase and documentation to indicate the level of compliance with the above standards. They appear in the format:

```
[AIR-X][AIS-Y][BPC-Z][RES-W]
```

Where X, Y, Z, and W are the respective levels (1, 2, or 3) for each standard.

## Verification

The compliance verification system ensures that implementations meet the requirements of the claimed standards. Verification is performed through:

1. Automated tests
2. Code reviews
3. Documentation audits
4. Performance benchmarks

Each module in the Anya Core system must maintain compliance with its declared standards to ensure overall system integrity and interoperability.
