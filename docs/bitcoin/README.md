# Bitcoin Protocol Implementation

## Overview

The Bitcoin implementation in Anya Core provides a comprehensive integration with the Bitcoin protocol, supporting advanced features such as Taproot, Schnorr signatures, and Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT). This implementation is fully compliant with official Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) including BIP-340 (Schnorr Signatures), BIP-341 (Taproot), BIP-342 (Tapscript), BIP-174 (PSBT), and BIP-370 (PSBT v2).

This directory contains documentation for the Bitcoin protocol implementation in Anya Core.

## Architecture

The implementation follows a hexagonal architecture pattern with:

- **Core**: Core Bitcoin functionality
- **Adapters**: Integration with external systems
- **Ports**: Interfaces for communication

## Key Components

### Core Components

- **Bitcoin Protocol**: Implementation of the Bitcoin protocol
- **Transaction Processing**: Handling of Bitcoin transactions
- **UTXO Management**: Management of unspent transaction outputs
- **Mempool**: Transaction memory pool implementation
- **Block Processing**: Processing of Bitcoin blocks

## BIP Implementation

The implementation supports the following BIPs:

- **BIP-340**: Schnorr Signatures for Bitcoin
- **BIP-341**: Taproot: SegWit version 1 spending rules
- **BIP-342**: Validation of Taproot Scripts
- **BIP-174**: Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions
- **BIP-370**: PSBT Version 2

## Security Features

- **Secure Transaction Validation**: Comprehensive transaction validation
- **Advanced Cryptography**: Secure cryptographic implementations
- **Tamper-Proof Design**: Protection against tampering and manipulation
- **Security Auditing**: Regular security audits and vulnerability checks

## Features

- Full Bitcoin node integration
- SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) support
- Transaction creation and signing
- Address management
- Script support (P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH, P2TR, etc.)
- Taproot and Schnorr signature support
- PSBT v2 implementation

## Usage

The Bitcoin implementation provides:

- Transaction creation and signing
- Block validation and processing
- UTXO management
- Mempool management
- Network communication

## Development

To contribute to the Bitcoin implementation:

1. Read the [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Follow the [AI Labeling Standards](../standards/AI_LABELING.md)
3. Ensure all code meets [BIP Compliance Standards](../standards/BIP_COMPLIANCE.md) requirements

## Testing

All Bitcoin components are tested using:

- Unit tests in `tests/bitcoin/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/bitcoin/`
- Consensus tests from the Bitcoin Core test suite
- Fuzz testing for critical components
