## Overview

The Ports module implements a hexagonal architecture pattern for the Anya Core system, providing well-defined interfaces between the application core and external systems. This module follows the Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5 specifications for hexagonal architecture with strict BIP compliance.

## Hexagonal Architecture

The Ports module adopts the hexagonal architecture (also known as ports and adapters) pattern to:

- Separate business logic from technical implementations
- Enable easier testing through dependency inversion
- Facilitate interoperability with different external systems
- Provide a clear separation of concerns

## Node Communication Port

The `node_communication` submodule defines interfaces for Bitcoin network communication.

### NodeCommunicationPort

The primary interface for Bitcoin node communication, enabling P2P network operations.

#### Key Operations

- `connect`: Connect to the Bitcoin P2P network
- `broadcast_transaction`: Broadcast a transaction to the network
- `get_mempool_stats`: Retrieve statistics about the mempool
- `is_synced`: Check if the node is synchronized with the network

#### Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::ports::node_communication::NodeCommunicationPort;

async fn broadcast_bitcoin_tx<T: NodeCommunicationPort>(
    port: &T,
    tx_hex: &str
) -> Result<String, BitcoinError> {
    // Connect to the network if not already connected
    if !port.is_synced().await? {
        port.connect().await?;
    }

    // Broadcast the transaction
    let txid = port.broadcast_transaction(tx_hex).await?;

    // Return the transaction ID
    Ok(txid)
}
```

### Data Structures

The module defines several important data structures:

- **MempoolStats**: Statistics about the Bitcoin mempool
- **FeeStats**: Detailed fee information for the mempool

## Additional Ports

While the module currently focuses on node communication, it is designed to be extended with additional ports including:

- **WalletPort**: Interface for wallet operations
- **BlockchainPort**: Interface for blockchain data access
- **StoragePort**: Interface for persistent storage
- **CryptoPort**: Interface for cryptographic operations

## Adapter Implementation

The ports defined in this module are designed to be implemented by adapter classes that connect to specific technologies:

- **BitcoinCoreAdapter**: Implementation for Bitcoin Core RPC
- **ElectrumAdapter**: Implementation for Electrum servers
- **EsploraAdapter**: Implementation for Esplora API

## Integration Points

The Ports module integrates with:

- **Bitcoin Module**: For Bitcoin protocol implementation
- **Network Module**: For network communication
- **Configuration Module**: For port configuration
