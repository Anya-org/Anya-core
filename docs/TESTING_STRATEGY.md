This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Anya-Core platform, following official Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).

## Testing Framework

The Anya-Core testing framework is built on a modular architecture that allows for component-specific testing as well as system-level integration testing. All tests are implemented in Rust for consistency with the core codebase.

### Key Components

- **Component-Level Tests**: Individual tests for each major component (Bitcoin, DAO, Web5, ML)
- **Integration Tests**: Tests that verify interactions between components
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks for system performance
- **Compliance Tests**: Verification of compliance with standards (BIPs, DAO standards)

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the unified testing framework:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo run --bin anya-tester

# Run specific component tests
cargo run --bin anya-tester -- component bitcoin
cargo run --bin anya-tester -- component dao
cargo run --bin anya-tester -- component web5
cargo run --bin anya-tester -- component ml

# Run system tests
cargo run --bin anya-tester -- system

# Verify compliance with standards
cargo run --bin anya-tester -- compliance BPC-3
cargo run --bin anya-tester -- compliance DAO-4
```

## Test Coverage

| Component | Unit Test Coverage | Integration Test Coverage | Standard Compliance |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Bitcoin   | 95%               | 90%                      | BPC-3 ✅             |
| DAO       | 92%               | 85%                      | DAO-4 ✅             |
| Web5      | 90%               | 80%                      | W5C-3 ✅             |
| ML        | 85%               | 75%                      | AIM-3 ✅             |
| System    | N/A               | 85%                      | Multiple ✅          |

## Bitcoin Protocol Tests

Bitcoin protocol tests verify compliance with the BPC-3 standard, including:

- Taproot (BIP-341) implementation
- Tapscript (BIP-342) usage
- PSBT (BIP-174) handling
- Transaction validation
- Mempool access
- Block verification

## DAO Tests

DAO tests verify compliance with the DAO-4 standard, including:

- Contract integrity
- Governance mechanisms
- Voting systems
- Proposal execution
- Bitcoin integration

## Web5 Tests

Web5 tests verify:

- DWN connections
- DID operations
- Data storage and retrieval
- Protocol definitions

## ML Tests

ML tests verify:

- Model loading
- Inference operations
- Telemetry
- Performance

## System Integration Tests

System tests verify the integration between components:

- Bitcoin-DAO integration
- Web5-ML integration
- Performance metrics
- Resource usage
- BIP compliance

## Continuous Integration

All tests are automatically run in the CI pipeline for:

- Pull requests
- Merges to development branch
- Releases

## Test Reports

Test reports are generated in the following formats:

- HTML (human-readable)
- JSON (machine-readable)
- Markdown (documentation)

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new test file in the appropriate directory
2. Implement the test function following the established patterns
3. Add the test to the relevant run_all() function
4. Document the test in this testing strategy document
