This document outlines the complete tokenomics system for the Anya Governance Token (AGT), including distribution model, emission schedule, and treasury management framework.

## Token Specifications

- **Name**: Anya Governance Token
- **Symbol**: AGT
- **Total Supply**: 21,000,000,000 AGT
- **Decimals**: 8
- **Token Standard**: Clarity SIP-010 Compatible

## Distribution Model

The AGT token distribution is designed to create a balance between protocol sustainability, community incentives, and operational requirements:

### Strategic Distribution Breakdown

```
Total Supply: 21,000,000,000 AGT

35% Protocol Treasury (7,350,000,000 AGT)
  • 15% Strategic Reserves (3,150,000,000 AGT)
  • 20% Ecosystem Development (4,200,000,000 AGT)

25% Liquidity Provision (5,250,000,000 AGT)
  • 15% Initial DEX Liquidity (3,150,000,000 AGT)
  • 10% Ongoing Liquidity Mining (2,100,000,000 AGT)

20% Team & Development (4,200,000,000 AGT)
  • 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
  • Milestone-based release triggers

15% Community Incentives (3,150,000,000 AGT)
  • Governance participation rewards
  • Protocol usage incentives

5% Strategic Partners & Advisors (1,050,000,000 AGT)

```

## Emission Schedule

AGT follows an adaptive Bitcoin-inspired emission model with governance-controlled parameters:

- **Initial Block Reward**: 10,000 AGT
- **Minimum Halving Interval**: 105,000 blocks
- **Halving Reduction**: 50% (consistent with Bitcoin model)
- **Adaptive Controls**:
  - Network usage metrics
  - Treasury utilization rate
  - Governance-approved adjustment triggers

### Emission Schedule Table

| Phase | Block Range | Block Reward | Tokens Released |
|-------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1     | 0-105,000   | 10,000 AGT   | 1,050,000,000  |
| 2     | 105,001-210,000 | 5,000 AGT | 525,000,000   |
| 3     | 210,001-315,000 | 2,500 AGT | 262,500,000   |
| 4     | 315,001-420,000 | 1,250 AGT | 131,250,000   |
| ...   | ...         | ...          | ...            |

*Note: The actual halving interval may be adjusted through governance proposals based on protocol performance metrics.*

## Treasury Management Framework [AIR-3][DAO-3][BPC-3]

The Protocol Treasury is managed through the DAO governance system with the following guidelines:

### Treasury Management Principles

1. **Protocol-Owned Liquidity Strategy**
   - Minimum of 15% of DEX allocation maintained as protocol-owned liquidity
   - Revenue from protocol operations directed to increase POL over time
   - DAO-controlled trading strategy during extreme market conditions

2. **Reserve Requirements**
   - Minimum 15% of circulating supply maintained in strategic reserves
   - Reserve ratio adjustable through governance with 75% supermajority

3. **Circuit Breakers**
   - Treasury operations automatically limited during extreme market volatility
   - Emergency freeze mechanism requiring multi-signature approval

4. **Buyback and Burn Mechanism**
   - Protocol revenue can be allocated to token buybacks
   - Buyback frequency and amount determined by governance
   - Transparent burn mechanism with on-chain verification

## Distribution Release Schedule

### Initial Release

- **Protocol Treasury**: 20% available at launch, 80% time-locked
- **Liquidity Provision**: 50% available at launch, 50% released over 18 months
- **Team & Development**: 0% at launch, 1-year cliff, then linear vesting over 3 years
- **Community Incentives**: 10% available at launch, 90% released through reward programs
- **Strategic Partners**: 10% at launch, 3-year linear vesting for remainder

### Vesting Schedule

| Allocation | Launch | 6 Months | 12 Months | 24 Months | 36 Months | 48 Months |
|------------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Protocol Treasury | 20% | 30% | 40% | 60% | 80% | 100% |
| Liquidity | 50% | 67% | 83% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Team & Dev | 0% | 0% | 25% | 50% | 75% | 100% |
| Community | 10% | 25% | 40% | 70% | 90% | 100% |
| Partners | 10% | 20% | 33% | 67% | 100% | 100% |

## Governance Controls

The emission and distribution parameters can be modified through governance proposals with the following requirements:

- **Emission Rate Changes**: 67% approval, 10% quorum
- **Treasury Allocation Changes**: 75% approval, 15% quorum
- **Vesting Schedule Changes**: 80% approval, 25% quorum

## Market Operations

The DAO can authorize the following market operations through governance:

1. **Liquidity Management**
   - Add/remove liquidity from trading pairs
   - Adjust fee tiers and reward distributions
   - Rebalance liquidity across trading venues

2. **Buyback Operations**
   - Set periodic buyback schedules
   - Establish price targets for buyback execution
   - Determine burn vs. treasury allocation ratio

3. **Strategic Investments**
   - Allocate treasury funds to ecosystem projects
   - Establish investment criteria and return metrics
   - Manage investment portfolio diversification

## Implementation Details

The tokenomics system is implemented through:

- Clarity smart contracts for on-chain governance
- Rust backend for execution and monitoring
- Web5 DWN for transparent record-keeping
- ML analytics for market operation optimization

## Auditing and Transparency

All token movements and treasury operations are:

- Recorded on-chain with transaction hashes
- Published to a public dashboard
- Subjected to quarterly independent audits
- Verified through cryptographic proof of reserves

## Version Control

- **Current Version**: 2.0.0
- **Last Updated**: [CURRENT_DATE]
- **Previous Version**: 1.0.0 (Bitcoin-fixed halving model)
