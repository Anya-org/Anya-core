# Anya Core Agent Architecture
[AIS-3][BPC-3][DAO-3]

## Overview

The Anya Agent Architecture provides a comprehensive framework for autonomous intelligent agents that manage various aspects of the DAO ecosystem. Following a hexagonal architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns, the agent system enables dynamic responses to market conditions, protocol metrics, and governance decisions.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design** - Core domain logic is isolated from external systems
2. **Hexagonal Architecture** - Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure
3. **Event-Driven Design** - Agents react to system events and metrics
4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Fail-safe mechanisms prevent cascading failures
5. **Multi-Signature Security** - Critical operations require multiple approvals
6. **Simulation-First Approach** - Operations are simulated before execution
7. **ML-Enhanced Decision Making** - Machine learning models guide agent decisions

## Core Components

### Operations Manager

The Operations Manager serves as the central coordination layer that orchestrates all agent activities, workflow scheduling, and operational monitoring.
