## Overview

The Security module provides comprehensive security functionality for the Anya Core platform, including system hardening, cryptographic operations, input validation, and hardware security module (HSM) support.

## Core Components

### System Hardening

Implements configuration and enforcement of security levels, system hardening policies, and validation of system integrity.

- `SystemHardening`: Main interface for system hardening
- `HardeningConfig`: Configuration for hardening policies
- `SecurityLevel`: Enum for security levels
- `ConfigStatus`: Status of hardening configuration

### Cryptographic Operations

Provides cryptographic primitives and operations, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, and signing.

- `crypto`: Core cryptographic operations
- `encryption`: Symmetric encryption utilities
- `constant_time`: Constant-time operations for side-channel resistance

### Software HSM

Implements a software-based hardware security module for key management, signing, and encryption.

- `SoftwareHSM`: Main interface for software HSM
- `EncryptionRequest`, `EncryptionResponse`: Types for encryption operations
- `SigningRequest`, `SigningResponse`: Types for signing operations
- `HSMConfig`, `HSMMetrics`: Configuration and metrics for HSM
- `HashAlgorithm`, `KeyPurpose`, `SoftwareKeyType`: Types for key management

### Hardware Security Module (HSM)

Provides hardware-backed cryptographic operations when enabled via feature flag.

- `HsmConfig`, `HsmProvider`, `KeyGenParams`, `KeyType`, `SigningAlgorithm`, `HsmManager`, `HsmStatus`: Interfaces and types for hardware HSM

### Input Validation

Includes utilities for validating inputs and enforcing security policies.

## Integration Points

- **Resource Module**: For secure resource management
- **Performance Module**: For monitoring security operations
- **GDPR Module**: For privacy and data protection compliance
- **Backup Module**: For secure backup and recovery
