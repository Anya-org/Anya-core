## Overview
This guide details the comprehensive security architecture integrating Bitcoin, Web5, and ML components.

## Core Security Components

### 1. Multi-Layer Authentication

### 2. Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration

The Anya Core platform now implements a comprehensive Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration with multiple provider types:

#### Provider Types

- **Software HSM**: Development and testing environment with secure key storage
- **Hardware HSM**: Integration with physical devices (YubiHSM, Ledger, Trezor)
- **Simulator HSM**: Testing environment simulating HSM behavior
- **Bitcoin HSM**: Specialized for Bitcoin operations with HD wallet support

#### Key Features

- Secure key generation and storage
- Cryptographic operations (signing, verification, encryption)
- Multiple key types (RSA, EC, AES, Ed25519)
- Bitcoin-specific operations with Taproot support
- Comprehensive audit logging

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
hsm:
  provider_type: BitcoinHsm
  audit_enabled: true
  bitcoin:
    network: Testnet
    derivation_path_template: "m/84'/1'/0'/0/{index}"
    use_taproot: true
    confirm_transactions: true
```

#### Security Benefits

- Hardware-backed cryptographic operations
- Secure storage of private keys
- Comprehensive audit trail
- Protection against key exfiltration
- Support for Bitcoin-specific operations
