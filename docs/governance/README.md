## Overview

The Governance module implements a decentralized governance system for Anya Core, providing mechanisms for token-based voting, proposal management, and consensus-based decision making. The module follows a Bitcoin-inspired governance model with an AGT (Anya Governance Token) system.

## Core Components

### AGTGovernanceProtocol

Bitcoin-inspired governance token model that manages the token supply and emission schedule.

#### Key Features

- Fixed total supply of 21 million AGT
- Bitcoin-like halving mechanism (every 210,000 blocks)
- Initial block reward of 50 AGT
- Supply calculation and verification

#### Usage Example

```rust
let protocol = AGTGovernanceProtocol::new();
let total_mined = protocol.calculate_total_mined_supply();
let can_mint = protocol.can_mint(1_000_000);
```

### DAOGovernance

Decentralized governance implementation that manages proposals and voting processes.

#### Key Features

- Proposal submission and management
- Voting mechanisms with configurable thresholds
- Quorum requirements for proposal validity
- Proposal finalization and execution

#### Usage Example

```rust
let dao = DAOGovernance::new();
dao.submit_proposal(proposal).await?;
dao.cast_vote(proposal_id, voter, vote).await?;
let status = dao.finalize_proposal(proposal_id).await?;
```

## Data Structures

### Proposal

Represents a governance proposal within the system.

#### Properties

- `id`: Unique identifier for the proposal
- `title`: Short descriptive title
- `description`: Detailed proposal description
- `proposer`: Identity of the proposal creator
- `proposer_token_balance`: Token balance of the proposer
- `votes`: Collection of cast votes
- `status`: Current status of the proposal

### Vote

Represents a vote cast by a token holder.

#### Properties

- `voter`: Identity of the voter
- `decision`: Vote decision (For, Against, or Abstain)
- `voting_power`: Voting weight based on token balance

### Enums

- `ProposalStatus`: Tracks proposal lifecycle (Active, Passed, Failed, Executed)
- `VoteDecision`: Represents voting options (For, Against, Abstain)

## Governance Process

1. **Proposal Creation**: Token holders with sufficient balance (above proposal threshold) can submit proposals
2. **Voting Period**: Eligible token holders cast votes with voting power proportional to their token balance
3. **Quorum Check**: Ensures sufficient participation (default: 30% of total token supply)
4. **Decision**: Proposal passes if it reaches the voting threshold (default: 60% majority)
5. **Execution**: Passed proposals are marked for execution

## Configuration Parameters

- `voting_threshold`: Percentage of votes needed to pass a proposal (default: 60%)
- `proposal_threshold`: Minimum token balance required to submit a proposal (default: 100 AGT)
- `quorum_percentage`: Minimum participation required for valid vote (default: 30%)

## Compliance Standards

### AIR-3

Availability & Integrity Requirement Level 3: The Governance module ensures high availability and data integrity through robust concurrent access control, consensus mechanisms, and immutable proposal records.

### AIS-3

Application Integration Standard Level 3: Provides comprehensive APIs for seamless integration with other Anya Core components, particularly the DAO module.

### BPC-3

Bitcoin Protocol Compatibility Level 3: Implements a Bitcoin-inspired token model with fixed supply, halving mechanisms, and cryptographic security standards.

### RES-3

Resource Efficiency Standard Level 3: Optimized for efficient operation with minimal resource overhead, scalable voting mechanisms, and efficient token tracking.
