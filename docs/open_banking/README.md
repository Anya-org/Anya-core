# Open Banking Module

[Compliance: [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3][RES-3]]

## Overview

This module provides Open Banking integration capabilities, enabling secure fiat-to-crypto on-ramp and off-ramp services with full regulatory compliance. It's source-aligned with `/src/open_banking/mod.rs` and implements strong customer authentication (SCA) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance.

## Core Components

### OpenBankingEngine

The main engine that coordinates fiat gateway operations, compliance checking, and blockchain integration for Open Banking services.

#### Features

- Secure fiat deposit and withdrawal processing
- Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) compliance
- Real-time foreign exchange (FX) rate integration
- Taproot commitment for blockchain proof
- PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction) support
- Regulatory compliance monitoring

#### Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::open_banking::{OpenBankingEngine, Currency, FiatDepositProof};
use std::sync::Arc;

fn process_fiat_deposit() -> Result<FiatDepositProof, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let engine = OpenBankingEngine::new(
        fiat_gateway,
        compliance_engine,
        fx_oracle
    );

    // Process secure fiat deposit with compliance
    let deposit_proof = engine.deposit_fiat(1000.0, Currency::EUR)?;

    println!("Deposit processed with blockchain commitment: {}",
             deposit_proof.blockchain_commitment);

    Ok(deposit_proof)
}
```

### FiatGateway

Secure gateway interface for processing fiat currency transactions through regulated banking partners.

#### Properties
