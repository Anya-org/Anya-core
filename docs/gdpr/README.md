## Overview

The GDPR module provides compliance mechanisms for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) within the Anya Core system. It implements privacy-preserving features, including the right to erasure, cryptographic redaction proofs, and blockchain anchoring for auditability.

## Key Features

### Right to Erasure (GDPR Article 17)

Implements the right to erasure, allowing users to request deletion of their personal data. The module generates cryptographic proofs of redaction and anchors them to the Bitcoin blockchain for auditability.

#### Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::gdpr::right_to_erasure;

let proof = gdpr.right_to_erasure()?;
println!("Redaction proof: {:?}", proof);
```

### RedactionProof

A data structure representing the proof of data redaction, including:

- Merkle root of redacted data
- Zero-knowledge proof of erasure
- Timestamp of redaction
- Blockchain commitment for auditability

## Compliance Mechanisms

- **Merkle Tree Construction**: Efficiently represents redacted data
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verifies erasure without revealing sensitive data
- **Blockchain Anchoring**: Commits redaction events to the Bitcoin blockchain for transparency

## Integration Points

- **Security Module**: For cryptographic operations
- **Storage Module**: For data management and redaction
- **Performance Module**: For monitoring redaction operations

## Compliance Standards

### AIR-3

Ensures high availability and integrity by providing robust redaction and audit mechanisms.

### AIS-3

Comprehensive APIs for integration with privacy management systems and external compliance tools.

### BPC-3

Anchors redaction proofs to the Bitcoin blockchain for protocol compatibility and auditability.

### RES-3

Efficient redaction and proof generation with minimal resource usage.
