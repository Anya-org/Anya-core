# Bitcoin Protocol Compliance

[AIS-3][BPC-3][DAO-3]

## Overview

The Anya DAO is designed to fully comply with Bitcoin protocol standards and best practices, ensuring compatibility, security, and interoperability with the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## BIP Compliance Status

| BIP | Description | Status | Implementation |
|-----|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 341 | Taproot | âœ… | Treasury operations, voting |
| 174 | PSBT | âœ… | Transaction creation, multi-sig |
| 370 | PSBT v2 | ðŸ”„ | Advanced operations (in progress) |
| 342 | Tapscript | âœ… | Governance script validation |

## Bitcoin Development Framework Compliance

This implementation follows the Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5 requirements:

1. **Protocol Adherence**
   - Bitcoin-style issuance with halving schedule
   - Uses Clarity's trait system for interface consistency
   - Maintains decentralized governance principles
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation
2. **Privacy-Preserving Architecture**
   - Constant product market maker formula for DEX
   - Vote delegation through proxy patterns
   - Private proposal submission options
   - Secure admin controls with proper authorization checks
3. **Asset Management Standards**
   - Governance token uses SIP-010 standard
   - Proper token integration with mint functions
   - Token balance validation for proposal submission
   - Strategic distribution for liquidity and governance
4. **Security Measures**
   - Admin-only access for sensitive operations
   - Multi-level validation for all operations
   - Comprehensive logging for auditing
   - Clear separation of responsibilities between components

## BIP-341 Implementation

Taproot implementation details:

- **Treasury Operations**: Uses Taproot for multi-signature control
- **Schnorr Signatures**: Aggregated signatures for vote validation
- **MAST Contracts**: Merkle Abstract Syntax Trees for conditional execution
- **Key Path Spending**: Optimized spending path for standard operations
- **Script Path Spending**: Complex script execution for special cases

Example implementation:

```clarity
;; Taproot validation (simplified)
(define-public (verify-taproot-signature
                 (message (buff 64))
                 (signature (buff 64))
                 (public-key (buff 32)))
  (verify-schnorr message signature public-key)
)
```

## BIP-174 Compliance

Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) implementation:

- **Transaction Templates**: Standard templates for different operation types
- **Multi-Signature Support**: Threshold signatures for treasury operations
- **Hardware Wallet Integration**: Compatible with standard hardware wallets
- **PSBT Exchange Format**: Standardized format for transaction passing

Example PSBT flow:

```typescript
// Create a PSBT for a treasury operation
const psbt = new DAO.PSBT()
  .addInput({
    hash: 'treasury-utxo-hash',
    index: 0,
    witnessUtxo: treasuryOutput
  })
  .addOutput({
    address: 'recipient-address',
    value: operationAmount
  });

// Each signer adds their signature
const signedPsbt = await signer1.signPsbt(psbt);
const finalPsbt = await signer2.signPsbt(signedPsbt);

// Finalize and extract transaction
const transaction = finalPsbt.extractTransaction();
```

## Validation Workflows

### BIP-341 Validation Cycle

The Taproot validation cycle follows these steps:

1. **Proposal Creation**: Governance proposal is created and hashed
2. **Schnorr Signature**: Voters sign the proposal hash with Schnorr signatures
3. **MAST Commitment**: Execution conditions are committed via MAST structure
4. **Execution**: Successful proposals are executed via appropriate spending path

### BIP-174 PSBT Flow

The PSBT transaction flow consists of:

1. **Construction**: Creating the initial PSBT with inputs and outputs
2. **Validation**: Validating the transaction against policy rules
3. **Signing**: Multiple parties sign the transaction as required
4. **Broadcast**: The finalized transaction is broadcast to the network

## Cross-Chain Execution

- **Bitcoin SPV Proof Verification**: Simplified Payment Verification for cross-chain actions
- **RSK Bridge Integration**: Taproot-enabled bridge for RSK interaction
- **Legal Compliance Wrappers**: Regulatory compliance components (DAO-4 standard)
