# DAO System Upgrade & Enhancement Proposal [DAO-3][BPC-3][AIR-3][AIS-3][RES-3][AIT-3][AIM-3][SCL-3][PFM-3][DID-3][W5C-3][UXA-3]

## Executive Summary

This proposal recommends a substantive upgrade to the Anya Core DAO system, firmly aligning it with the latest Bitcoin protocol enhancements, robust modular architecture, advanced on-chain/off-chain governance, and comprehensive monitoring and resilience. The enhancements are driven by BIP 341/342/174, Miniscript, testnet-first deployment, and a hexagonal, cross-layer design.

---

## 1. Motivation & Goals

- Achieve **full BIP-341/342/174 compliance** and Miniscript support for all governance actions and treasury operations.
- Enable testnet-first validation for every module and protocol upgrade.
- Adopt a robust hexagonal architecture for pluggable adapters (Lightning/BOLT12, Taproot Assets, DLCs, etc.).
- Strengthen security, upgrade monitoring, and ensure resilience to attacks and network events.
- Enhance DAO smart contract capabilities for cross-chain, privacy-preserving, and oracle-driven governance.

## 2. Technical Enhancement Overview

### 2.1 Protocol & Compliance Upgrades

- **Taproot/Tapscript (BIP-341/342):**
  - Complete support for Taproot key/script-path spending, Schnorr signatures, and Tapscript validation ([docs/bitcoin/taproot.md](../docs/bitcoin/taproot.md), [anya-bitcoin/docs/security/taproot-security.md](bitcoin/docs/security/taproot-security.md)).
  - Cross-input Schnorr signature aggregation for privacy and efficiency ([docs/web5/TAPROOT_INTEGRATION.md](../docs/web5/TAPROOT_INTEGRATION.md)).
- **PSBT (BIP-174):**
  - PSBT creation, validation, and signing for all multisig and treasury flows.
- **Miniscript:**
  - Policy compilation, script analysis, and witness generation for DAO-controlled funds and advanced governance logic ([docs/HEXAGONAL.md](../docs/HEXAGONAL.md)).
- **Testnet-First Validation:**
  - All protocol changes, adapters, and contracts must be validated on Bitcoin testnet before mainnet deployment ([docs/UPGRADE.md](../docs/UPGRADE.md)).

### 2.2 Modular, Hexagonal Architecture

- **Adapters:** Pluggable adapters for each protocol and network:
  - Lightning Network (BOLT12): Off-chain voting, micro-payouts, and instant DAO actions.
  - Taproot Assets: Native asset issuance for DAO tokens and NFTs.
  - DLC Oracle Interface: Oracle-driven proposals and contingent governance ([docs/web5/TAPROOT_INTEGRATION.md](../docs/web5/TAPROOT_INTEGRATION.md)).
  - Cross-layer state manager for unified DAO state ([docs/HEXAGONAL.md](../docs/HEXAGONAL.md)).
- **Node and Wallet Interface:** Unified P2P node management and wallet with multisig, PSBT, Taproot, and asset support.

### 2.3 DAO Smart Contracts & Governance

- **Cross-chain & Privacy:** Enable confidential treasury/voting (Liquid, RGB), on-chain voting (Stacks), and oracle-driven execution (DLC).
- **Advanced Proposal Types:** Add "System Upgrade" to proposal types ([contracts/dao/dao-governance.clar](../contracts/dao/dao-governance.clar)), with new action targets for protocol upgrades.
- **Metrics Oracle:** Expand DAO metrics to cover TPS, block propagation, mempool depth, UTXO growth, participation, and security events ([contracts/dao/metrics-oracle.clar](../contracts/dao/metrics-oracle.clar)).
- **Continuous Improvement:** Scheduled reviews, automated audits, and community-driven enhancement workflows ([DAO.md](../DAO.md)).

---

## 3. Security, Resilience, & Monitoring

- **Security Model:**
  - Multi-signature execution, DLC-based oracles, constant-time cryptography, and hardware-backed key storage ([anya-bitcoin/docs/security/taproot-security.md](bitcoin/docs/security/taproot-security.md)).
- **Resilience:** Automated incident response: Security Incident → BIP Validation → Testnet Deployment → Mainnet Patch ([docs/UPGRADE.md](../docs/UPGRADE.md)).
- **Monitoring:**
  - Prometheus metrics for BIP compliance, mempool size, Taproot usage, block propagation time ([src/monitoring/metrics.rs](../src/monitoring/metrics.rs)).
  - Security metrics: 51% attack detection, fee spike analysis, validation failure alerts.
  - Performance: UTXO set growth, SegWit/Taproot adoption ([contracts/dao/metrics-oracle.clar](../contracts/dao/metrics-oracle.clar)).

---

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Protocol & Monitoring Upgrade

- Integrate full Taproot/Tapscript/Miniscript/PSBT support in all DAO and treasury flows.
- Expand Prometheus metrics and deploy monitoring dashboards.

### Phase 2: Cross-Layer DAO Enhancement

- Finalize and test modular adapters: Lightning (BOLT12), Taproot Assets, DLC, and cross-layer state manager.
- Enable testnet validation for all new adapters and flows.

### Phase 3: Security & Governance Hardening

- Adopt best practices for Schnorr/MuSig2, deterministic nonce generation, hardware-backed keys.
- Automate hotfix and incident response protocol; regular security and resilience audits.

### Phase 4: Advanced DAO & Community Features

- Add new proposal types, metrics, and governance workflows.
- Expand community and developer documentation; empower open enhancement proposals.

---

## 5. Labeling & Compliance

- All modules must include compliant labels per [AI_LABELING.md](../docs/standards/AI_LABELING.md):

  ```text
  [DAO-3][BPC-3][AIR-3][AIS-3][RES-3][AIT-3][AIM-3][SCL-3][PFM-3][DID-3][W5C-3][UXA-3]
  ```

- Scripts and CI must validate label compliance before merge.
