## Remaining Disabled Code Categories

### 🚫 **Feature Flag Disabled Code** - **SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED**

#### **Bitcoin Feature Conditional Compilation** - **ENHANCED BUT REMAINING**

**Location**: Throughout `src/bitcoin/` and `src/api/routes.rs`  
**Current Status**: ✅ **ENHANCED** - Bitcoin operations now integrated with HSM system  
**Remaining Issue**: API surface still changes based on build configuration  

**Phase 1 Week 1 Improvements**:

- ✅ Bitcoin operations integrated with HSM provider factory
- ✅ Enhanced PSBT signing with secure key management  
- ✅ Multi-network support (Mainnet, Testnet, Regtest, Signet)
- ✅ Native secp256k1 integration for optimal performance

**Remaining Work** (Phase 1 Week 3-4):

- Implement graceful degradation instead of empty routers
- Add feature status endpoints for API surface consistency  
- Document feature dependencies clearly

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks (reduced from 2-3 weeks)  
**Priority**: Medium (reduced from High)  

#### **HSM Feature Complete Disable**

**Location**: `src/security/hsm_shim.rs`  
**Issue**: All HSM operations return errors when disabled  

```rust
### 💔 **Commented Out Code** - **PRIORITY UPDATES**

#### **Bitcoin Wallet Module** - **PHASE 1 WEEK 3 PRIORITY**

**Location**: `src/bitcoin/mod.rs`  
**Current Status**: ✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** - HSM foundation now complete  
**Issue**: Entire wallet functionality commented out pending HSM integration  

```rust
pub mod bip;
pub mod network;
// pub mod wallet;  // TODO: Re-enable when HSM foundation complete ✅
// pub mod mining;  // Mining functionality disabled
```

**Phase 1 Week 1 Foundation Complete**:

- ✅ HSM provider factory with intelligent fallback ready for wallet integration
- ✅ Bitcoin-optimized signing operations with PSBT support
- ✅ HD wallet key derivation support via HSM providers
- ✅ Multi-network configuration and validation

**Remediation Strategy** (Phase 1 Week 3-4):

- Implement HD wallet with BIP-32/44 support using HSM key derivation
- Add UTXO management and transaction building with HSM signing
- Enable comprehensive testing with HSM provider integration
- Implement proper error handling and HSM fallback validation

**Effort**: 6-8 weeks (reduced from 8-12 with HSM foundation)  
**Priority**: Critical (Phase 1 Week 3)  

#### **Enterprise Database Connections**

**Location**: `src/enterprise/database/mod.rs`  
**Issue**: Database operations commented out  

```rust
// use sqlx::{PgPool, migrate::MigrateDatabase};
pub struct DatabaseConnection {
    // pool: PgPool,  // Commented out - no actual connection
}
```

**Impact**: No persistent storage for enterprise features  
**Remediation Strategy**:

- Implement proper connection pooling
- Add database migration system
- Enable health checks and monitoring
- Add proper error handling and recovery

**Effort**: 4-6 weeks  
**Priority**: High  

### 🔧 **Stub Implementations**

#### **Compliance Module Mocks**

**Location**: `src/compliance/`  
**Issue**: All compliance checks return mock success results  

```rust
impl AmlChecker {
    pub fn check_transaction(&self, _tx: &Transaction) -> AmlResult {
        // Mock implementation - always returns Ok
        AmlResult::Approved
    }
}
```

**Impact**: No actual compliance validation (critical regulatory risk)  
**Remediation Strategy**:

- Integrate with real AML/KYC providers
- Implement proper risk assessment algorithms
- Add comprehensive audit logging
- Enable regulatory reporting capabilities

**Effort**: 12-16 weeks  
**Priority**: Critical (for enterprise)  

#### **DLC Oracle Stubs**

**Location**: `src/bitcoin/dlc/oracle.rs`  
**Issue**: Oracle client compiles but all methods panic  

```rust
impl OracleClient {
    pub fn get_attestation(&self, event_id: &str) -> Result<Attestation, Error> {
        panic!("Oracle integration not implemented")
    }
}
```

**Impact**: DLC functionality completely broken  
**Remediation Strategy**:

- Implement real oracle client integration
- Add multiple oracle support for redundancy
- Enable event verification and validation
- Add proper error handling for oracle failures

**Effort**: 6-8 weeks  
**Priority**: Medium  

### 🧪 **Disabled Test Infrastructure**

#### **Security Tests Disabled**

**Location**: `tests/bitcoin/security_tests.rs`  
**Issue**: All critical security tests marked with `#[ignore]`  

```rust
#[test]
#[ignore = "Security infrastructure not ready"]
fn test_private_key_security() {
    // Critical security test disabled
}
```

**Impact**: No security validation in CI/CD pipeline  
**Remediation Strategy**:

- Implement security test infrastructure
- Enable hardware security testing
- Add penetration testing automation
- Create security regression test suite

**Effort**: 6-8 weeks  
**Priority**: Critical  

#### **Integration Tests Minimal**

**Location**: `tests/integration_tests.rs`  
**Issue**: Only stub implementation with single passing test  

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_integration_stub() {
    assert!(true, "Integration test stub ran");
}
```

**Impact**: No integration validation between components  
**Remediation Strategy**:

- Implement end-to-end test scenarios
- Add multi-component integration testing
- Enable performance and load testing
- Create comprehensive test data management

**Effort**: 8-10 weeks  
**Priority**: Critical  

## Non-Functional Code Analysis

### 💥 **Code That Compiles But Fails at Runtime**

#### **Web5 Module Dependencies**

**Location**: `src/web5/`  
**Issue**: Feature enabled but dependency unavailable  

```rust
// Cargo.toml shows:
// web5 = { version = "0.1.0", optional = true }  # Dependency not available
```

**Impact**: Build fails when web5 feature enabled  
**Remediation Strategy**:

- Implement Web5 protocol from scratch
- Add DID and verifiable credentials support
- Enable decentralized identity management
- Create comprehensive testing framework

**Effort**: 10-12 weeks  
**Priority**: Medium  

#### **Cross-Chain Bridge Logic**

**Location**: `src/bitcoin/cross_chain/bridge.rs`  
**Issue**: Methods exist but contain `unimplemented!()` macros  

```rust
pub fn create_bridge_transaction() -> Result<Transaction, Error> {
    unimplemented!("Cross-chain bridging not yet implemented")
}
```

**Impact**: Runtime panics when bridge functionality called  
**Remediation Strategy**:

- Implement RSK and Liquid bridge protocols
- Add atomic swap mechanisms
- Enable cross-chain validation
- Add comprehensive security measures

**Effort**: 12-16 weeks  
**Priority**: Low  

## Error Handling Issues

### 🚨 **Inadequate Error Management**

#### **Generic Error Types**

**Location**: `src/error.rs`  
**Issue**: Basic error implementation without context  

```rust
pub struct Error {
    message: String, // No error codes, context, or recovery info
}
```

**Impact**: Poor debugging and error recovery experience  
**Remediation Strategy**:

- Implement structured error types with codes
- Add error context and stack trace preservation
- Enable error recovery mechanisms
- Create user-friendly error messages

**Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: Medium
