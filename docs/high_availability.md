# High Availability System \[AIR-3\]\[AIS-3\]\[RES-3\]\[SCL-3\]

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 line-length -->

This document describes the High Availability (HA) subsystem of Anya Core, detailing the architecture, components, and operational characteristics that ensure continuous operation even in the face of failures.

## Overview

The High Availability subsystem provides fault tolerance, automatic failover, and resilience capabilities to Anya Core. It implements a distributed coordination mechanism that ensures service continuity even when individual nodes or components fail.

## Architecture

The HA system follows the hexagonal architecture pattern defined in the Bitcoin Development Framework v2.5:

```
                  +----------------+
                  | Cluster API    |
                  +-------+--------+
                          |
+----------------+  +-----v--------+  +----------------+
|   Discovery    |  |   Cluster    |  |   Monitoring   |
|   Services     <--+   Manager    +-->   & Metrics    |
| (DNS, K8s, etc)|  |              |  | (Prometheus)   |
+----------------+  +-------+------+  +----------------+
                          |
                  +-------v--------+
                  | Node Management|
                  | & Health Checks|
                  +----------------+
```

## Key Components \[AIR-3\]

### Cluster Manager

The `ClusterManager` is the central component of the High Availability subsystem. It manages:

- Node discovery and registration
- Leader election
- Health monitoring
- Fault detection
- Automatic failover
- Configuration synchronization

```rust
/// Cluster Manager for high availability operations
/// \[AIR-3\]\[RES-3\]\[SCL-3\]
pub struct ClusterManager {
    config: ClusterConfig,
    nodes: HashMap<NodeId, NodeInfo>,
    current_leader: Option<NodeId>,
    status: ClusterStatus,
}
```

### Node Discovery Services \[AIR-3\]

Multiple node discovery mechanisms are supported:

1. **Static Configuration**: Pre-configured list of nodes
2. **DNS Discovery**: SRV record-based discovery
3. **Kubernetes Discovery**: Kubernetes API-based discovery
4. **Multicast Discovery**: Local network discovery via multicast

### Membership Service \[RES-3\]

The Membership Service tracks node status and manages:

- Node join/leave operations
- Health check protocols
- Heartbeat monitoring
- Split-brain detection
- Quorum-based decisions

### Health Monitoring \[RES-3\]

Comprehensive health monitoring includes:

- Regular heartbeat checks
- Application-level health probes
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Response time measurements
- Error rate tracking

## Leader Election \[AIR-3\]\[RES-3\]

The leader election algorithm is based on the Raft consensus protocol with the following properties:

1. **Safety**: At most one leader can be elected in a given term
2. **Liveness**: A new leader will eventually be elected if the current one fails
3. **Fault Tolerance**: The system can tolerate up to (N-1)/2 node failures

The election process follows these steps:

1. All nodes start in follower state
2. If a follower receives no communication, it becomes a candidate
3. A candidate requests votes from other nodes
4. Nodes vote for at most one candidate per term
5. A candidate becomes the leader if it receives votes from a majority of nodes

## Fault Detection and Recovery \[RES-3\]

The system detects and handles various failure scenarios:

| Failure Type | Detection Method | Recovery Action |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Node Crash | Missed heartbeats | Leader election |
| Network Partition | Quorum loss | Partition healing |
| Performance Degradation | Slow response time | Load balancing |
| Resource Exhaustion | Resource metrics | Auto-scaling |
| Application Errors | Error rate increase | Restart service |

## Configuration Synchronization \[AIR-3\]

The HA subsystem ensures configuration consistency across the cluster:

1. Leader maintains the authoritative configuration
2. Configuration changes are propagated to all nodes
3. Version tracking prevents conflicts
4. Two-phase commit ensures atomic updates
5. Roll-back capability for failed updates

## Security Considerations \[AIS-3\]

The HA system implements these security measures:

1. **TLS Mutual Authentication**: All node-to-node communication is encrypted and authenticated
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for administrative operations
3. **Audit Logging**: All cluster operations are logged with tamper-evident records
4. **Network Isolation**: Control plane traffic is isolated from data plane
5. **Secure Bootstrap**: Nodes are securely provisioned with initial credentials

## Performance Characteristics \[AIP-3\]

The HA subsystem is designed for optimal performance:

- Low-latency leader election (<500ms in typical conditions)
- Efficient heartbeat protocol with minimal network overhead
- Scalable to 100+ nodes without significant performance degradation
- Configurable monitoring intervals based on deployment requirements
- Low CPU and memory footprint (<5% of system resources)

## Bitcoin-Specific Considerations \[AIR-3\]\[AIS-3\]

For Bitcoin operations, the HA system provides additional guarantees:

1. **Transaction Consistency**: Ensures no double-spending during failover
2. **UTXO Set Integrity**: Maintains consistent UTXO references across nodes
3. **Blockchain State**: Synchronizes blockchain view across all nodes
4. **HSM Coordination**: Manages distributed HSM operations securely
5. **DLC Contract Continuity**: Ensures DLC contracts remain valid during failover

## Usage Examples

### Basic HA Cluster Configuration

```rust
let config = ClusterConfig {
    node_id: "node-1".to_string(),
    discovery_method: DiscoveryMethod::Static {
        nodes: vec!["node-1:7800".to_string(), "node-2:7800".to_string(), "node-3:7800".to_string()],
    },
    bind_address: "0.0.0.0:7800".to_string(),
    heartbeat_interval: Duration::from_secs(1),
    election_timeout: Duration::from_secs(5),
    ..Default::default()
};

let cluster_manager = ClusterManager::new(config);
cluster_manager.initialize().await?;
cluster_manager.join_cluster().await?;

// Get cluster status
let status = cluster_manager.get_status().await?;
println!("Current leader: {:?}", status.current_leader);
println!("Cluster nodes: {:?}", status.nodes);
```

### Custom Health Check Configuration

```rust
let health_config = HealthCheckConfig {
    checks: vec![
        HealthCheck::Http {
            name: "api".to_string(),
            url: "http://localhost:8080/health".to_string(),
            interval: Duration::from_secs(5),
            timeout: Duration::from_secs(1),
            expected_status: 200,
        },
        HealthCheck::Custom {
            name: "bitcoin-sync".to_string(),
            command: Box::new(|ctx| {
                Box::pin(async move {
                    // Check Bitcoin synchronization status
                    let bitcoin_client = ctx.get_service::<BitcoinClient>().unwrap();
                    let sync_status = bitcoin_client.get_sync_status().await?;
                    Ok(sync_status.blocks_remaining < 10)
                })
            }),
            interval: Duration::from_secs(30),
        },
    ],
    aggregation: HealthAggregation::All,
};

cluster_manager.configure_health_checks(health_config).await?;
```

## Testing and Verification \[AIT-3\]

The HA subsystem undergoes rigorous testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: All components have comprehensive unit tests
2. **Chaos Testing**: Random node failures are simulated
3. **Network Partition Testing**: Various network partition scenarios
4. **Performance Testing**: Behavior under load and stress conditions
5. **Long-running Tests**: Stability verification over extended periods

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the HA subsystem include:

1. **Geo-distributed Clustering**: Support for multi-region deployments
2. **Automatic Scaling**: Dynamic node addition/removal based on load
3. **Enhanced Observability**: Advanced metrics and diagnostics
4. **Custom Consensus Protocols**: Pluggable consensus mechanisms
5. **Integrated Backup Management**: Automated backup and restore
