## Overview

The Web module provides web-related functionality for the Anya Core system, with a focus on Web5 protocol integration. This module serves as a bridge between the core system and decentralized web technologies, enabling identity management, data ownership, and credential verification.

## Core Components

### Web5 Adapter

The `web5_adapter` submodule provides a comprehensive adapter for Web5 protocol functionality, including DID (Decentralized Identifier), DWN (Decentralized Web Node), and VC (Verifiable Credential) operations.

#### Key Features

- DID creation and resolution
- DWN interaction for decentralized data storage
- Verifiable Credential issuance and verification
- Web5 protocol compatibility

#### Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::web::web5_adapter::Web5Adapter;

fn interact_with_web5() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>> {
    // Create a Web5 adapter
    let adapter = Web5Adapter::new("https://web5-service.example.com");

    // Create a new DID
    let did_doc = adapter.create_did("ion")?;
    println!("Created DID: {}", did_doc.did);

    // Resolve an existing DID
    let resolved = adapter.resolve_did(&did_doc.did)?;

    // Use the DID for further operations
    // ...

    Ok(())
}
```

## Web5 Protocol Integration

The Web module provides comprehensive integration with the Web5 protocol stack:

### Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

The module supports various DID methods:

- **ION**: Bitcoin-anchored DIDs using the ION network
- **Key**: Simple key-based DIDs for testing and lightweight use cases
- **Web**: Web-based DIDs for compatibility with existing systems

### Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)

Integration with DWNs for decentralized data storage:

- **Message Storage**: Secure storage of encrypted messages
- **Record Management**: CRUD operations for user-controlled data
- **Query Capabilities**: Advanced querying of stored data
- **Permission Management**: Granular access control for shared data

### Verifiable Credentials

Support for the Verifiable Credentials data model:

- **Credential Issuance**: Creation of signed credentials
- **Credential Verification**: Cryptographic verification of credentials
- **Presentation Generation**: Creation of credential presentations
- **Schema Validation**: Validation against credential schemas

## Integration Points

The Web module integrates with:

- **Security Module**: For cryptographic operations
- **Network Module**: For web communication
- **Storage Module**: For credential and DID persistence
- **Configuration Module**: For Web5 service configuration
