## Overview

The Resource Management module provides utilities for managing system resources within the Anya Core system. This module helps ensure efficient allocation and utilization of system resources such as memory, connections, and processing capacity.

## Core Components

### ResourceManager

The primary interface for resource management operations, providing methods for resource allocation, health monitoring, and connection management.

#### Key Features

- Resource allocation and deallocation
- Connection management
- Health monitoring
- Memory usage tracking

#### Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::resource::ResourceManager;

async fn manage_resources() -> Result<(), String> {
    // Create a resource manager
    let manager = ResourceManager::new().await;

    // Check resource health
    let health = manager.check_resource_health().await;

    if health.is_healthy && health.memory_usage_percent < 80.0 {
        // Acquire a resource connection
        let connection = manager.acquire_connection().await?;

        // Allocate memory for operation
        manager.allocate_memory(1024 * 1024).await?; // 1MB

        // Use the connection for operations...
    } else {
        return Err("System resources low".to_string());
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### ResourceConnection

A representation of a managed connection to a system resource, providing controlled access to underlying system capabilities.

### ResourceHealth

A data structure representing the health status of system resources, including metrics like memory usage percentage and overall health status.

## Resource Management Strategies

The Resource Management module implements several strategies for efficient resource utilization:

1. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse of connections to minimize overhead
2. **Adaptive Allocation**: Dynamic resource allocation based on system load
3. **Resource Limits**: Enforcement of upper bounds on resource usage
4. **Priority-Based Access**: Resource allocation based on operation priority

## Performance Optimization

The module includes performance optimization features:

- **Lazy Initialization**: Resources are allocated only when needed
- **Resource Reclamation**: Automatic cleanup of unused resources
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of resource usage across available capacity
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identification of resource constraints

## Integration Points

The Resource Management module integrates with:

- **Network Module**: For network connection management
- **Storage Module**: For storage resource allocation
- **ML Module**: For ML inference resource management
- **Configuration Module**: For resource policy configuration
