## Mobile SDK Alignment & Roadmap (June 2025)

- Rust backend (`src/mobile/sdk.rs`) provides async wallet, transaction, and security logic as a minimal template.
- No FFI/mobile bridge (JNI/Swift) is implemented yet; all mobile integration is planned.
- Biometric, backup, wipe, and fee estimation features are documented but not yet implemented in Rust.
- Contributors are encouraged to help implement FFI bindings, wrappers, and missing features for full parity with the documented API.
- See [docs/mobile/SDK.md](./mobile/SDK.md) for the latest status and mapping between Rust and mobile APIs.
