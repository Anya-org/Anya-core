## Development Process

We have implemented a sectional testing approach that focuses on checking code quality and functionality rather than building full test suites for each component. This approach:

1. Reduces time spent on CI/CD processes
2. Provides faster feedback on code changes
3. Focuses testing resources on critical path components
4. Automatically updates milestone tracking

### Bitcoin Development Framework Compliance

All components are required to meet specific compliance standards:

| Requirement | Implementation | Verification Method |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Protocol Adherence | Core Bitcoin specifications | Automated checks + Manual review |
| Privacy Architecture | Privacy-by-design patterns | Static analysis tools |
| Asset Management | Taproot-enabled standards | Integration tests |
| Memory Optimization | Resource-efficient patterns | Memory profiling |

### Testing Methodology

Our new testing methodology focuses on verification rather than exhaustive testing:

1. **Check Operations**: Use cargo check, clippy, and other static analysis tools
2. **Sectional Testing**: Test specific sections of code based on changes
3. **Memory Profiling**: Check memory usage without running intensive tests
4. **Automated Documentation**: Update milestone tracking based on test results

## Looking Ahead

### Q2 2025

1. Complete security and compliance features
2. Launch mobile SDK beta
3. Deploy enterprise security features
4. Release cross-chain messaging protocol

### Q3 2025

1. Launch production-ready mobile applications (React Native)
2. Implement quantum-resistant cryptography
3. Achieve performance targets
4. Deploy multi-tenant architecture
