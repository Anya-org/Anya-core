3. **Strategic Investments**
   - Protocol investments
   - Ecosystem funding
   - Partnership development
4. **Reserve Management**
   - Asset diversification

   - Risk management

## Treasury Guards

To ensure responsible treasury management:

- **Spending Limits**: Tiered approval requirements based on amount
- **Circuit Breakers**: Emergency pause during extreme conditions
- **Time Locks**: Graduated waiting periods based on impact
- **Audits**: Quarterly independent audits

## Implementation Details

### Treasury Contract

The treasury is implemented using a multi-signature contract with tiered access controls:

```clarity
;; Treasury implementation (simplified)
(define-data-var treasury-balance uint u0)

;; Treasury operation types
(define-constant OP-LIQUIDITY u1)
(define-constant OP-BUYBACK u2)
(define-constant OP-INVEST u3)
(define-constant OP-RESERVE u4)

;; Execute a treasury operation
(define-public (execute-operation 
                 (operation-type uint) 
                 (amount uint) 
                 (target principal))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-authorized-by-governance tx-sender) (err u100))
    (asserts! (>= (var-get treasury-balance) amount) (err u101))
    
    ;; Perform the operation based on type
    (var-set treasury-balance (- (var-get treasury-balance) amount))
    
    ;; Additional logic based on operation type
    (if (is-eq operation-type OP-LIQUIDITY)
        (execute-liquidity-operation amount target)
        (if (is-eq operation-type OP-BUYBACK)
            (execute-buyback-operation amount)
            (if (is-eq operation-type OP-INVEST)
                (execute-investment-operation amount target)
                (execute-reserve-operation amount target))))
  )
)
```

### Spending Tiers

The treasury implements tiered approval requirements based on the amount being spent:

| Tier | Amount Range | Required Approvals | Timelock |
|------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | < 10,000 AGT | 2 signers | 24 hours |
| 2 | 10,000 - 100,000 AGT | 3 signers | 48 hours |
| 3 | 100,000 - 1,000,000 AGT | 5 signers | 72 hours |
| 4 | > 1,000,000 AGT | Governance vote | 7 days |

### Quarterly Audit Process

The treasury undergoes a quarterly audit process:

1. **Balance Verification**: Confirm all reported balances match on-chain state
2. **Operation Review**: Analyze all treasury operations from the previous quarter
3. **Compliance Check**: Verify all operations followed governance approvals
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate current treasury composition and risks
5. **Report Publication**: Publish audit results to the community

## Treasury Dashboard

The treasury dashboard provides real-time visibility into:

- **Asset Allocation**: Current distribution of treasury assets
- **Operation History**: Record of all treasury operations
- **Performance Metrics**: Treasury growth and utilization metrics
- **Scheduled Operations**: Upcoming treasury operations in timelock
