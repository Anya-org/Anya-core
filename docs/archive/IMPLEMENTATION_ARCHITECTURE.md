## Overview

This document describes the technical components and their interactions for the Anya Core and DAO implementation, providing a blueprint for the system's structure and behavior, both on-chain and off-chain.

## On-Chain Components

The DAO is implemented with the following on-chain components:

- **Governance Contract**: Main DAO contract for proposal submission and voting
- **Treasury Contract**: Manages the DAO treasury assets and operations
- **Token Contract**: AGT token implementation with governance capabilities
- **Proposal Registry**: Tracks all proposals and their lifecycle states

## Off-Chain Components

Supporting off-chain components include:

- **DAO Dashboard**: Web interface for governance participation
- **Analytics Suite**: Governance metrics and insights dashboard
- **Notification System**: Alerts for proposals and votes
- **Discussion Forum**: Platform for proposal discussion and refinement
