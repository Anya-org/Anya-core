## Overview

The Anya DAO implements multiple security layers to protect the protocol, treasury, and governance processes against various attack vectors and vulnerabilities.

## Security Layers

The DAO implements multiple security layers:

- **Multi-Signature Requirements**: For critical operations
- **Time Locks**: Delayed execution of significant changes
- **Security Council**: Emergency response capability
- **Formal Verification**: Of all governance contracts
- **Bug Bounty Program**: For vulnerability reporting
- **Taproot Audits**: Quarterly Tapscript verification
- **PSBT Validation**: Hardware wallet integration checks
- **BIP Compliance**: Automated protocol checks
  - Weekly BIP-341 signature validation
  - Daily BIP-174 transaction audits

## Treasury Guards

### Spending Limits

Treasury spending limits are implemented with multi-tier approval requirements:

| Operation Size | Required Approvals | Timelock Duration |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| < 10,000 AGT | 2 of 5 signers | 24 hours |
| 10,000 - 100,000 AGT | 3 of 5 signers | 48 hours |
| > 100,000 AGT | Full governance vote | 7 days |

### Circuit Breakers

Automatic circuit breakers activate under abnormal conditions:

1. **Unusual Activity Detection**:
   - Large transfers (>1% of treasury)
   - Rapid succession of transactions (>5 in 10 minutes)
   - Multiple operations targeting the same recipient

2. **Market Condition Triggers**:
   - Price movement >30% in 24 hours
   - Liquidity decrease >50% in 24 hours
   - Trading volume spike >5x 7-day average

3. **Network Security Concerns**:
   - Blockchain reorganization >3 blocks
   - Hash rate decrease >30% in 24 hours
   - Unusual mempool congestion patterns

## Governance Security

### Voting Security

- **Sybil Resistance**: Token-weighted voting prevents identity-based attacks
- **Vote Privacy**: Optional private voting mechanism
- **Delegation Guardrails**: Limits on delegation concentration
- **Vote Verification**: On-chain verification of all votes
- **Anti-Flash Loan Protection**: Snapshot voting at proposal creation time

### Proposal Security

- **Spam Prevention**: Minimum token requirement for proposals
- **Malicious Proposal Detection**: Technical review period
- **Execution Timelock**: Delay between approval and execution
- **Cancellation Mechanism**: Emergency stop for problematic proposals

## Technical Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

```clarity
;; Security measures in smart contracts (simplified example)
(define-public (execute-sensitive-operation (params (list 10 uint)))
  (begin
    ;; 1. Authorization check
    (asserts! (is-authorized tx-sender) (err u100))
    
    ;; 2. Parameter validation
    (asserts! (validate-parameters params) (err u101))
    
    ;; 3. Rate limiting check
    (asserts! (not (rate-limited)) (err u102))
    
    ;; 4. Execute with logging
    (log-sensitive-operation tx-sender params)
    (perform-operation params)
  )
)
```

### External Security Reviews

The DAO undergoes regular external security audits:

1. **Quarterly Contract Audits**: By recognized security firms
2. **Annual Penetration Testing**: Of the full ecosystem
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Through security partners
4. **Formal Verification**: Of critical contract components

## Vulnerability Management

The DAO implements a comprehensive vulnerability management process:

1. **Bug Bounty Program**: Incentives for responsible disclosure
2. **Security Response Team**: Dedicated team for vulnerability handling
3. **Vulnerability Classification**:
   - Critical: Immediate response (<24 hours)
   - High: Rapid response (<3 days)
   - Medium: Planned response (<7 days)
   - Low: Scheduled fix in next update
4. **Post-Incident Analysis**: Learning and improvement

## Emergency Response Procedures

In the event of a security incident:

1. **Detection & Analysis**: Identify and assess the incident
2. **Containment**: Activate circuit breakers if necessary
3. **Remediation**: Deploy fixes and patches
4. **Communication**: Transparent disclosure to community
5. **Recovery**: Return to normal operations
6. **Post-Incident Review**: Document lessons learned
