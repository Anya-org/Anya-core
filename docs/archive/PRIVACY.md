# Privacy Measures

This document outlines the privacy protection measures implemented in Anya Core.

## Overview

Anya Core implements comprehensive privacy protection measures to ensure user data security and transaction privacy while maintaining Bitcoin protocol compliance.

## Privacy Features

### 1. Transaction Privacy

- **Confidential Transactions**: Implementation of privacy-preserving transaction protocols
- **Address Management**: HD wallet support for enhanced address privacy
- **UTXO Privacy**: Advanced UTXO management for transaction unlinkability

### 2. Data Protection

- **Local Storage**: All sensitive data stored locally with encryption
- **No Data Collection**: No user data transmitted to external servers
- **Secure Communication**: End-to-end encryption for all network communications

### 3. Network Privacy

- **Tor Support**: Built-in Tor integration for network-level privacy
- **Peer Discovery**: Privacy-preserving peer discovery mechanisms
- **Traffic Analysis Resistance**: Measures to prevent traffic correlation attacks

## Implementation Details

### Cryptographic Primitives

- **Encryption Algorithms**: AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 and scrypt for key derivation
- **Digital Signatures**: Schnorr signatures for enhanced privacy

### Privacy-Preserving Protocols

- **CoinJoin**: Implementation of collaborative transaction protocols
- **Stealth Addresses**: Support for stealth address protocols
- **Ring Signatures**: Research and development of ring signature implementations

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Address Reuse**: Always use new addresses for each transaction
2. **Network Configuration**: Use Tor for enhanced network privacy
3. **Local Storage**: Keep wallet files encrypted and secure

### For Developers

1. **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
2. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices
3. **Privacy by Design**: Implement privacy considerations from the start

## Compliance

- **GDPR Compliance**: Adherence to European privacy regulations
- **Data Protection Laws**: Compliance with relevant data protection legislation
- **Industry Standards**: Following cryptocurrency privacy best practices
