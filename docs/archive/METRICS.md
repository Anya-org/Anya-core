## Metrics Architecture

Anya-Core implements a comprehensive metrics system that follows the hexagonal architecture pattern, ensuring clean separation between core business logic and monitoring concerns.

### Core Components

- **Metrics Collector**: Centralized collection of all system metrics
- **Data Processing**: Real-time processing and aggregation of metrics data
- **Storage Layer**: Efficient storage of historical metrics data
- **Alert Engine**: Intelligent alerting based on configurable thresholds
- **Dashboard Interface**: Real-time visualization of system health
