## Overview

The Extensions module provides extension capabilities for Anya Core, allowing for customizable functionality beyond the core system. This module serves as an extensibility framework that enables developers to add new features, integrate with external systems, and customize behavior without modifying the core codebase.

## Structure

The Extensions module is designed to be lightweight and serves primarily as a framework for loading and managing extensions. The actual extension implementations are contained in separate modules or packages.

## Extension System Features

- **Plugin Architecture**: Support for dynamically loading and unloading extensions at runtime
- **Extension Registry**: Central registry for managing available extensions
- **Extension Lifecycle Management**: Initialization, configuration, and cleanup of extensions
- **Extension Dependency Resolution**: Handling dependencies between extensions

## Extension Types

### Core Extensions

Core extensions are built-in extensions that provide fundamental functionality:

- Authentication extensions
- Storage extensions
- Networking extensions
- Cryptography extensions

### User Extensions

User extensions are custom extensions created by developers:

- Custom transaction types
- Integration with external services
- Specialized wallet features
- Analytics and reporting tools

## Integration Points

The Extensions module integrates with other Anya Core modules through well-defined interfaces:

- **Configuration**: Extensions can extend the configuration system
- **API**: Extensions can add new API endpoints
- **Events**: Extensions can subscribe to system events
- **Data Models**: Extensions can define custom data models

## Development

To create a new extension:

1. Implement the extension interface
2. Register the extension with the extension registry
3. Define extension configuration parameters
4. Implement extension lifecycle methods

## Compliance Standards

### AIR-3

Availability & Integrity Requirement Level 3: The Extensions module ensures high availability and data integrity through robust extension validation, error handling, and isolation of extension failures.

### AIS-3

Application Integration Standard Level 3: Provides comprehensive APIs for seamless integration of extensions with Anya Core components and external systems.

### BPC-3

Bitcoin Protocol Compatibility Level 3: Ensures that all extensions adhere to Bitcoin protocol standards and best practices through a standardized validation framework.

### RES-3

Resource Efficiency Standard Level 3: Implements efficient resource management for extensions, including memory isolation, resource limits, and performance monitoring.
