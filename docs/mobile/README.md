## Overview

The Mobile module provides integration points for mobile platforms to interact with the Anya Core system. It includes a complete SDK for mobile applications and FFI (Foreign Function Interface) bindings for native platform integration.

## Components

### MobileSDK

The primary interface for mobile applications, providing a high-level API for wallet management, network operations, and security functions.

#### Key Features

- **Wallet Management**: Initialize, sync, and manage Bitcoin wallets
- **Transaction Operations**: Create, sign, and broadcast Bitcoin transactions
- **Security Functions**: Generate addresses, implement biometric authentication
- **State Management**: Track wallet balances, addresses, and transaction history

#### Usage Example

```rust
let sdk = MobileSDK::new();
sdk.initialize_wallet(mnemonic).await?;
sdk.sync_wallet().await?;
let info = sdk.get_wallet_info().await?;
let txid = sdk.send_transaction(recipient, amount).await?;
```

### FFI Bindings

Native platform bindings that expose the MobileSDK functionality to languages like Swift (iOS) and Kotlin/Java (Android).

#### Available Functions

- `anya_initialize_wallet`: Initialize a wallet with a given mnemonic
- `anya_sync_wallet`: Synchronize wallet with the blockchain
- `anya_send_transaction`: Create and broadcast a transaction
- `anya_get_wallet_info`: Retrieve current wallet information
- `anya_wipe_wallet`: Clear all wallet data
- `anya_estimate_fee`: Calculate transaction fee for a given amount
- `anya_free_string`: Memory management function to free strings returned by FFI

## Architecture

The Mobile module is structured as follows:

1. **SDK Layer** (`sdk.rs`): High-level Rust API for mobile integration
2. **FFI Layer** (`ffi.rs`): C-compatible interface for native platform integration
3. **Platform Wrappers**: Expected to be implemented in Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS

## Security Considerations

- The module implements secure address generation from mnemonics
- Biometric authentication support is planned for secure access
- The wallet backup functionality includes provisions for secure storage

## Future Development

Planned features for the Mobile module include:

- Enhanced biometric authentication integration
- Comprehensive wallet backup and restore functionality
- Advanced fee estimation algorithms
- Additional transaction types support

## Integration Testing

Integration tests for FFI bindings should be added in:

- `tests/mobile_ffi.rs` for Rust-side tests
- Platform-specific test suites for Android and iOS integration

## Compliance Standards

### AIR-3
