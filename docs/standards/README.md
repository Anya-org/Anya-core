[AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3]

This directory contains the canonical standards documentation for the Anya Core project, in compliance with official Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).

## Available Standards

- [AI Labeling System](AI_LABELING.md) - The authoritative AI labeling documentation (Version 3.0)

## Implementation Requirements

All components in the Anya Core codebase must adhere to these standards. When introducing new components or modifying existing ones, refer to these documents for guidance on labeling, security requirements, and architectural constraints.

## Integration with Official Bitcoin Standards

These standards are aligned with official Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), ensuring proper implementation of:

1. Protocol Adherence
2. Privacy-Preserving Architecture
3. Asset Management Standards

## Versioning

Standards are versioned with a date-based system (YYYY-MM-DD). When standards are updated, old versions are archived and the canonical documents are updated with clear migration guidelines.

## Last Updated

March 20, 2025

## Purpose

The standards documentation serves as the authoritative reference for:

1. Code conventions and style guides
2. Architecture patterns and principles
3. System organization and design
4. Versioning and labeling systems

## Index of Documents

## Usage Guidelines

All team members must adhere to these standards. When developing new features or modifying existing code:

1. Review relevant standards documents
2. Apply conventions consistently
3. Update standards documentation if necessary

## Proposing Changes

To propose changes to standards:

1. Create a `docs/` branch from `main`
2. Make your changes to the relevant document(s)
3. Submit a PR with thorough explanation
4. Obtain approval from at least two senior team members
