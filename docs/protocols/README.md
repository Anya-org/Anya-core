# Protocols Module

[Compliance: [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3][RES-3]]

## Overview

This module contains protocol definitions and implementations for interoperability, security, and integration with external systems. It is source-aligned with `/src/protocols/mod.rs` and related protocol adapters.

## Features

- Defines core protocol traits and structures
- Integrates with Bitcoin adapters and other protocol modules
- Used in testing and cross-module communication

## Integration Points

- `/src/protocols/mod.rs`: Main protocol definitions
- `/src/bitcoin/adapters/protocols/mod.rs`: Bitcoin protocol adapters
- `/tests/protocols/mod.rs`: Protocol tests

## Usage

Import and use protocol traits and implementations for secure and compliant communication between modules and external systems.
