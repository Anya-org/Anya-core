|------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Node Down | Critical | Node offline | 5 minutes |
| High CPU | Warning | CPU > 90% for 5m | 15 minutes |
| Unauthorized Access | Critical | Failed login attempts | Immediate |
| SSL Expiry | Warning | Certificate expiring in < 30d | 24h |

### 3. Vulnerability Management [BPC-3]

#### Reporting Process

1. **Confidential Disclosure**
   - Email: `botshelomokoka+security@gmail.com`
   - PGP Key: [Available in `/security/pgp-key.asc`]
   - Encrypted communication required for sensitive reports

2. **Vulnerability Classification**
   - **Critical**: Immediate potential for fund loss or network compromise
   - **High**: Significant security risk requiring prompt attention
   - **Medium**: Security issue with limited impact
   - **Low**: Minor security concerns

3. **Response Timeline**
   - Initial Acknowledgment: Within 24 hours
   - Triage: Within 48 hours
   - Patch Development: 1-14 days (based on severity)
   - Public Disclosure: After patch availability

### 4. Secure Configuration [AIS-3]

#### Monitoring Security

- All monitoring endpoints require authentication
- TLS encryption for all communications
- Rate limiting on all APIs
- Regular security scans of container images
- Immutable infrastructure where possible

### 5. Access Control [RES-3]

- Principle of least privilege
- Multi-factor authentication for all administrative access
- Regular access reviews
- Audit logging of all privileged operations
