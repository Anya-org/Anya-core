## Overview

The Backup module provides functionality for creating, managing, and restoring backups of critical Anya Core data. This module is designed to ensure data durability and recovery capabilities across different components of the system.

## Module Structure

The Backup module consists of several subcomponents:

### Protocols

The `protocols.rs` file implements backup protocols for different data types and storage mechanisms, ensuring consistent backup procedures across the system.

### Machine Learning

The `ml.rs` file provides specialized backup functionality for machine learning models and training data, addressing the unique requirements of ML component persistence.

### Infrastructure

The `infrastructure.rs` file implements backup mechanisms for infrastructure components, including configuration, state, and operational data.

### Mock Implementation

The `mock.rs` file provides mock implementations of the backup interfaces for testing purposes.

## Backup Strategies

The Backup module implements several backup strategies:

1. **Incremental Backups**: Efficient storage of changes since the last backup
2. **Full Backups**: Complete snapshots of system state
3. **Differential Backups**: Backup of changes since the last full backup
4. **Cold Storage**: Secure offline backup for critical data

## Security Features

The Backup module incorporates several security features:

- **Encryption**: All backups are encrypted using industry-standard algorithms
- **Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic hashes ensure backup integrity
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for backup and restore operations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all backup operations

## Integration Points

The Backup module integrates with:

- **Storage Module**: For persistence of backup data
- **Security Module**: For encryption and access control
- **Network Module**: For distributed backup operations
- **Configuration Module**: For backup policy management

## Usage

While the implementation details are currently in development, the Backup module is designed to be used as follows:

```rust
use anya_core::backup::BackupManager;

async fn create_system_backup() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let backup_manager = BackupManager::new();

    // Configure backup policy
    backup_manager.configure(BackupConfig {
        encryption: true,
        compression: true,
        retention_days: 30,
        storage_location: "/secure/backups",
    })?;

    // Create backup
    let backup_id = backup_manager.create_backup().await?;

    println!("Backup created with ID: {}", backup_id);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Recovery Procedures

The Backup module provides comprehensive recovery procedures:

1. **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restore to a specific backup point
2. **Selective Recovery**: Restore specific components or data
3. **Verification**: Test backups before full restoration
4. **Automated Recovery**: Scripted recovery for operational continuity
