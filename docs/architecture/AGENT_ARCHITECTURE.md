# Anya Agent Systems Architecture

## Overview

Anya is a next-generation, multi-dimensional intelligent agent system designed to provide adaptive, ethical, and decentralized intelligence across multiple domains. This document provides a comprehensive framework for autonomous intelligent agents that manage various aspects of the DAO ecosystem. Following a hexagonal architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns, the agent system enables dynamic responses to market conditions, protocol metrics, and governance decisions.

## Architectural Principles

1.  **Domain-Driven Design** - Core domain logic is isolated from external systems
2.  **Hexagonal Architecture** - Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure
3.  **Event-Driven Design** - Agents react to system events and metrics
4.  **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Fail-safe mechanisms prevent cascading failures
5.  **Multi-Signature Security** - Critical operations require multiple approvals
6.  **Simulation-First Approach** - Operations are simulated before execution
7.  **ML-Enhanced Decision Making** - Machine learning models guide agent decisions
8.  **Decentralization** - No single point of failure, distributed decision making, and community-driven governance.
9.  **Ethical AI** - Transparent algorithms, fairness-first design, and continuous ethical evaluation.
10. **Adaptive Intelligence** - Dynamic learning, context-aware reasoning, and continuous self-improvement.
11. **Privacy and Security** - Zero-knowledge proofs, minimal data exposure, and cryptographic safeguards.
