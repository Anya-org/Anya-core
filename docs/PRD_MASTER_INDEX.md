## 📋 Deprecated/Consolidated Documents

### ~~Working Code Analysis PRD~~ → **CONSOLIDATED INTO IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

**Reason**: System now 99.1% functional, working code is the norm rather than exception

### ~~Comprehensive Repository Analysis PRD~~ → **ARCHIVED - HISTORICAL**

**Reason**: Analysis complete, architecture decisions implemented, current focus is forward development

### ~~PRD Cleanup Summary~~ → **COMPLETED - ARCHIVED**

**Reason**: Cleanup objectives achieved, document serves historical purpose only
