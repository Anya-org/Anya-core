*This diagram provides a high-level overview of the Anya-core system, showing the relationships between documentation, core modules, smart contracts, and testing.*

---

## Improvements Implemented
- Added a visual system map in Mermaid format for onboarding and documentation clarity.
- Ensured the main index references this map for quick navigation.

## Development Status (June 17, 2025)

**UPDATE:** Branch management and consolidation completed via PR #44 (branch-management-20250616). The project has made significant progress but is still under active development.

## Overview

The Anya Core System Map provides a high-level visual and descriptive overview of the system's architecture, major components, and their interactions. It serves as a reference for understanding the modular structure, integration points, and relationships between subsystems such as Bitcoin, Web5, ML, and security modules.

**Current Status:** Development in progress with branch consolidation completed as of June 17, 2025.

## Bitcoin Implementation Status - In Progress

### Core Integration Progress
- **Bitcoin Core Compilation:** Most critical errors resolved, some warnings remain
- **Build System:** Functional with ongoing improvements
- **Layer2 Protocols:** Various stages of development:
  - üîÑ BOB Protocol - In development
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Lightning Network - Partially integrated
  - üîÑ RSK (Rootstock) - In development
  - üîÑ RGB Protocol - Framework defined
  - üîÑ DLC Support - Base implementation
  - üîÑ Taproot Assets - Implementation in progress
