## Overview

The Core module provides foundational functionality for the Anya Core system, including performance optimization, reliability, and metrics collection. It orchestrates key system operations and ensures robust, efficient, and reliable execution of all components.

## Core Components

### CoreSystem

The main orchestrator for system operations, providing auto-save capabilities, input processing, and performance optimization.

#### Key Features

- Auto-save management for all components
- Input processing across modules
- Performance statistics and optimization

#### Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::core::CoreSystem;

let core = CoreSystem::new(60); // Auto-save every 60 seconds
core.process_input("new transaction")?;
let stats = core.get_auto_save_stats();
```

### Performance Optimization

Implements the `PerformanceOptimizer` for resource management and system tuning.

- Optimization status tracking
- Resource type management
- Performance change statistics

### Reliability

Provides reliability utilities for monitoring, recovery, and verification:

- `execute_with_monitoring`: Monitors system operations
- `execute_with_recovery`: Recovers from failures
- `AiVerification`: AI-based verification of system state
- `ProgressTracker`: Tracks progress of long-running operations
- `Watchdog`: Monitors system health and triggers alerts

### Metrics

Implements Prometheus-compatible metrics collection for system monitoring and analysis.

## Integration Points

- **Performance Module**: For optimization and monitoring
- **Resource Module**: For resource management
- **Test Module**: For reliability and recovery testing
- **Web Module**: For metrics reporting

## Compliance Standards

### AIR-3

Ensures high availability and integrity by providing robust monitoring, auto-save, and recovery mechanisms.

### AIS-3

Comprehensive APIs for integration with all system modules and external monitoring tools.

### BPC-3

Supports Bitcoin protocol operations and metrics for full compatibility.

### RES-3

Efficient resource management and performance optimization for minimal overhead.
