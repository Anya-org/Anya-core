# Tokenomics Module

[Compliance: [AIR-3][AIS-3][BPC-3][RES-3]]

## Overview

This module implements the complete economic models and tokenomics for the Anya protocol. It manages token distribution, reward mechanisms, and economic incentive structures aligned with the production parameters defined in the system. The module is source-aligned with `/src/tokenomics/mod.rs` and related submodules.

## Production Parameters (Source of Truth)

Based on `contracts/dao/tokenomics.clar`:

- **Total Supply**: 21,000,000,000 AGT tokens (21 billion)
- **Decimal Precision**: 8 decimals
- **Initial Block Reward**: 10,000 AGT tokens per block
- **Halving Interval**: 105,000 blocks
- **Distribution Model**: 35%/25%/20%/15%/5%

## Core Components

### TokenomicsEngine

The main tokenomics engine that coordinates all economic operations, reward distribution, and token supply management.

#### Features

- Token supply management and distribution
- Block reward calculation and halving
- Multi-tier distribution system
- Economic model validation
- Reward engine integration

#### Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::tokenomics::TokenomicsEngine;

fn manage_tokenomics() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let engine = TokenomicsEngine::new();

    // Calculate current block reward
    let current_block = 50000;
    let reward = engine.calculate_block_reward(current_block)?;
    println!("Block reward at block {}: {} AGT", current_block, reward);

    // Get distribution percentages
    let distribution = engine.get_distribution_model();
    println!("Treasury: {}%", distribution.treasury_percentage);

    // Process reward distribution
    engine.distribute_rewards(current_block, reward)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Economic Models (models submodule)

Defines the mathematical models and algorithms used for token economics.

#### Distribution Model

- **35%** Protocol Treasury - Long-term protocol development and sustainability
- **25%** Liquidity Provision - Market making and liquidity incentives
- **20%** Team & Development - Core team and developer incentives
- **15%** Community Incentives - User adoption and engagement rewards
- **5%** Strategic Partners - Ecosystem partnerships and integrations

### Reward Engine (rewards submodule)

Implements the reward calculation and distribution mechanisms.

#### Features

- Block-based reward calculation
- Halving schedule implementation
- Multi-category reward distribution
- Staking and delegation rewards
- Governance participation rewards

### Halving Schedule

Block rewards follow Bitcoin's halving model with adaptive intervals:

- **Blocks 0-105,000**: 10,000 AGT per block
- **Blocks 105,001-210,000**: 5,000 AGT per block
- **Blocks 210,001-315,000**: 2,500 AGT per block
- **Continues halving every 105,000 blocks**

## Integration Points

- `/src/tokenomics/mod.rs`: Main tokenomics implementation
- `/src/tokenomics/engine.rs`: Tokenomics engine
- `/src/tokenomics/models.rs`: Economic models

### AIS-3 (Alignment, Integration, and Security)

Provides secure integration with all economic components while maintaining alignment with production parameters and regulatory requirements.

### BPC-3 (Bitcoin Protocol Compliance)

Implements Bitcoin-compatible economic models including halving schedules, block-based rewards, and cryptographic security measures.

### RES-3 (Resilience and Error Handling)

Implements robust error handling for economic calculations, reward distribution failures, and system recovery procedures.

## Future Enhancements

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature treasury controls
- Time-locked reward distributions
- Economic attack prevention
- Inflation rate monitoring
- Supply audit mechanisms

## Maintainers

- Core team, tokenomics researchers, economic advisors
