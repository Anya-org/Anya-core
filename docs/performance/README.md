## Overview

The Performance module provides comprehensive monitoring, analysis, and reporting of system performance metrics within the Anya Core system. This module helps ensure optimal operation, identify bottlenecks, and maintain high availability through continuous performance assessment.

## Core Components

### PerformanceMonitor

The primary interface for performance monitoring operations, providing methods for recording metrics, generating reports, and performing health checks.

#### Key Features

- Request timing and success rate tracking
- System resource usage monitoring
- Health status reporting
- Performance report generation

#### Usage Example

```rust
use anya_core::performance::{PerformanceMonitor};
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

async fn process_with_monitoring() {
    let monitor = PerformanceMonitor::new();

    // Record system metrics
    monitor.update_system_metrics(45.2, 68.7).await; // CPU: 45.2%, Memory: 68.7%

    // Time an operation
    let start = Instant::now();
    let result = perform_operation().await;
    let duration = start.elapsed();

    // Record the request with its result
    monitor.record_request(duration, result.is_ok()).await;

    // Get health status
    let health = monitor.get_health_check().await;
    if health.status != "healthy" {
        log::warn!("System health degraded: {}", health.status);
    }

    // Generate performance report
    let report = monitor.generate_performance_report().await;
    log::info!(
        "Performance report: {} requests, {} errors",
        report.total_requests,
        report.total_errors
    );
}
```

### HealthCheck

A data structure representing the current health status of the system, providing a simple indicator of overall system health.

### PerformanceReport

A comprehensive report of system performance metrics, including request counts, error rates, and performance statistics.

## Monitoring Capabilities

The Performance module provides monitoring for several key metrics:

1. **Request Metrics**: Duration, success rates, and error counts
2. **System Resources**: CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O
3. **Network Performance**: Throughput, latency, and connection counts
4. **Database Operations**: Query times, connection pool usage
5. **Bitcoin-Specific Metrics**: Transaction processing times, mempool statistics

## Performance Analysis

The module includes analysis capabilities to identify performance issues:

- **Trend Analysis**: Detection of performance degradation over time
- **Threshold Alerting**: Notification when metrics exceed defined thresholds
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Pinpointing performance constraints
- **Outlier Detection**: Identification of anomalous performance patterns

## Integration Points

The Performance module integrates with:

- **Logging Module**: For performance-related logging
- **Network Module**: For network performance metrics
- **Storage Module**: For I/O performance tracking
- **Configuration Module**: For performance thresholds and settings

## Compliance Standards
