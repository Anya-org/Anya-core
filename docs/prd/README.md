## PRD index (August 8, 2025)

Authoritative PRD set for “Self-node master-by-default + production readiness”. Legacy PRDs are retired (soft-redirects remain to avoid broken links).

Files:

- 01_SYSTEM_STATUS_PRD.md — Current status and gaps (truth-to-source)
- 02_REQUIREMENTS_AND_SCOPE_PRD.md — What’s changing and why (inputs, success criteria)
- 03_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_PRD.md — Key architecture and integration points
- 04_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_PRD.md — Short execution plan with owners
- 05_QA_AND_VERIFICATION_PRD.md — Quality gates, scripts, and exit criteria

Conventions:

- Code is the source of truth; keep PRDs aligned.
- Commands should be runnable; prefer ./scripts/*.
- Update “Last Updated” on each edit.
