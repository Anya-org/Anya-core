## PRD index (August 8, 2025)

Minimal, focused PRD set for “Self-node master-by-default + production readiness”. Legacy PRDs are retired.

Files:
- 01_SCOPE_AND_OBJECTIVES.md — What’s changing and why (inputs, success criteria)
- 02_SYSTEM_STATUS_PRD.md — Current status and gaps (truth-to-source)
- 03_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_PRD.md — Short execution plan with owners
- 04_QA_AND_VERIFICATION_PRD.md — Quality gates, scripts, and exit criteria

Conventions:
- Code is the source of truth; keep PRDs aligned.
- Commands should be runnable; prefer ./scripts/*.
- Update “Last Updated” on each edit.
