# System Status PRD

Date: August 8, 2025
Version: 2.0.0 â€” Master-by-default + Productionization
Repository: Anya-core (branch: fix/-config-and-main-README-fixes)
Status: âœ… Core stable â€¢ ðŸ”„ Production integrations in progress

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary
- Default behavior: If no external nodes are configured or reachable, Anya Core becomes the primary (master) self-node automatically, while still auto-configuring peers when found.
- State/health: Health is OK when self-node is primary even if peers < min_peers; warns when discovery fails while prefer_self_as_master=true.
- Next milestone: Replace remaining simulation paths with production adapters backed by Bitcoin Core RPC.

## ðŸ“Š Compilation & Quality
- cargo check: PASS (as of latest local check)
- warnings: Target < 10 (track via scripts/quality_gate.sh)
- tests: All Layer2 tests previously passing; re-run before release

## ðŸ§© Components Snapshot
- Security/HSM: Production-ready (software HSM; audit logging; AES-GCM/RSA/Ed25519)
- Bitcoin Core: RPC client available; wire state/fees (height/hash/estimatesmartfee)
- Layer2: Manager/coordinator stable; production adapters pending for LN/RGB/DLC
- Storage: SQLite + RocksDB operational; metrics enabled
- AI/ML: Enhanced agentic system present; integration stabilization pending

## ðŸš§ Gaps To Close (P1)
1) Bitcoin Core RPC-backed state/fees plumbed into ProductionLayer2Protocol
2) Lightning adapter (LDK or LND gRPC) minimal operations
3) RGB client integration for basic schema/list/query
4) DLC oracle client wiring

## âœ… Verification Commands
```bash
cargo check --all-features
./scripts/quality_gate.sh
./scripts/verify_implementation_status.sh
```
