# OS-Agnostic Changes in Anya Core

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure Anya Core is fully OS-agnostic and can be built, tested, and run consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 1. Cross-Platform Build Scripts

### Shell Scripts for Both Windows and Unix
- Created PowerShell scripts for Windows users:
  - `fix_cargo_edition.ps1`: Fixes edition inheritance issues
  - `fix_core_package_refs.ps1`: Fixes package reference issues

- Created Bash scripts for macOS/Linux users:
  - `fix_cargo_edition.sh`: Fixes edition inheritance issues
  - `fix_core_package_refs.sh`: Fixes package reference issues

### Rust-Based Fix Utility
- Created a Rust-based fix utility in `rust-fix-scripts/` that works identically on all platforms
- Provides the same functionality as the shell scripts but with better error handling and reporting
- Supports dry-run mode to check issues without applying fixes

### Cross-Platform Makefile
- Created a unified `Makefile` that automatically detects the operating system
- Provides consistent build targets regardless of platform
- Handles platform-specific commands internally

## 2. Platform Abstraction Layer

- Created `platform.rs` to abstract platform-specific operations
- Provides unified interfaces for:
  - File paths and directories
  - Environment variables
  - Command execution
  - Configuration locations
  - OS detection

## 3. Build Documentation

- Created `BUILD_REQUIREMENTS.md` with detailed instructions for each platform:
  - Windows with Visual Studio
  - macOS with Xcode Command Line Tools
  - Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
  - Linux (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS)

## 4. Continuous Integration

- Set up GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/cross-platform-tests.yml`
- Tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux to ensure compatibility
- Generates artifacts for each platform

## 5. Cargo Workspace Fixes

- Fixed edition inheritance issues in Cargo.toml files
- Fixed package reference inconsistencies
- Removed conflicting workspace definitions

## Using These Changes

### Quick Start

1. Fix Cargo.toml issues:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   .\fix_cargo_edition.ps1
   .\fix_core_package_refs.ps1
   
   # macOS/Linux
   ./fix_cargo_edition.sh
   ./fix_core_package_refs.sh
   ```

2. Build using the Makefile:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

### Using the Rust Fix Tool

```bash
# Build the tool
make rust-fix-tool

# Check for issues
rust-fix-scripts/target/release/anya-fix-scripts fix-all

# Apply fixes
rust-fix-scripts/target/release/anya-fix-scripts fix-all --apply
```
