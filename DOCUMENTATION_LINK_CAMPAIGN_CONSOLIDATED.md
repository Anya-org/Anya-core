# Documentation Link Campaign - Consolidated

*Date: June 17, 2025*

## Overview

This document consolidates all information related to the documentation link fixing campaign for Anya-core. It outlines our approach, progress, tools, and next steps to address broken links and documentation structure issues.

## Current Status

A comprehensive analysis of the codebase has revealed:

- **604 markdown files** analyzed across the codebase
- **528 broken links** identified and documented
- Key tools and automation created for fixes
- Critical documentation paths currently being addressed

### Link Issue Categories

- Broken internal links between markdown files
- Missing reference documents that are linked to from other files
- Inconsistent link formats (relative vs. absolute paths)
- Outdated references to old GitHub repository URLs
- Disconnect between code implementation and documentation references

## Tools and Resources

We've developed a comprehensive toolkit to address these issues:

1. **Link Analysis and Fixing Tools:**
   - `scripts/link_campaign.py` - Advanced link checker with automatic fixing
   - `scripts/simple_link_campaign.py` - Robust implementation with reliable reporting
   - `scripts/fix_critical_links.py` - Targeted fixer for critical documentation paths
   - `scripts/validate_links_ci.sh` - CI integration for link validation

2. **Custom Link Mappings (`scripts/link_mappings.json`)**:
   - Manual mappings for problematic links
   - Currently contains mappings for installation documentation
   - Extensible for additional mappings as needed

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/docs-health-check.yml`)**:
   - Automated link checking in CI/CD pipeline
   - Markdown linting and documentation building
   - Weekly scheduled runs for proactive maintenance

## Implementation Progress

### Fixed Documentation Issues

1. **Missing Critical Files Created:**
   - ✅ `/docs/installation/troubleshooting.md`: Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
   - ✅ `/docs/installation/related1.md`: Reference to main installation document
   - ✅ `/docs/installation/related2.md`: Reference to installation review document

2. **Documentation Process Improvements:**
   - ✅ PR template for documentation changes (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/documentation.md`)
   - ✅ Campaign planning and tracking documentation
   - ✅ Link checking integrated into CI workflow

### Technical Challenges Addressed

1. **Path Resolution Issues:**
   - Fixed path normalization in link fixing scripts
   - Implemented better error handling for edge cases
   - Added custom mappings for problematic links

2. **Scale of the Problem:**
   - Prioritized critical documentation paths
   - Created automation for high-confidence fixes
   - Established systematic approach for remaining issues

## Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (Complete by June 19, 2025)

1. **Complete Critical Broken Links**
   - ⏳ Run `fix_critical_links.py` on all critical documentation paths
   - ⏳ Manually review and fix links that couldn't be automatically fixed
   - ⏳ Test all critical documentation paths for navigation

2. **Add Missing Documentation**
   - ⏳ Create all Priority 1 files in the Missing Documentation Reference Guide
   - ⏳ Update link mappings with additional patterns

3. **Complete CI Integration**
   - ⏳ Set up GitHub Actions workflow for documentation validation
   - ⏳ Configure pre-commit hooks for link checking

### Short-term Actions (Complete by June 30, 2025)

1. **Enhance Documentation Structure**
   - Implement consistent navigation between related documents
   - Ensure each document has proper "See Also" sections
   - Add breadcrumbs to improve navigation

2. **Create Priority 2 Documentation**
   - Implement markdown style guide
   - Add API reference documentation
   - Create Hexagonal architecture explanation

3. **Fix All Remaining Links**
   - Address all links identified in the link campaign report
   - Update link mappings with additional patterns as needed

### Long-term Maintenance (Ongoing)

1. **Regular Audits**
   - Weekly automated checks via GitHub Actions
   - Monthly manual review of documentation quality

2. **Documentation Metrics**
   - Track number of broken links over time
   - Monitor documentation coverage versus code

3. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Add feedback mechanisms to documentation
   - Address common documentation pain points

## Implementation Details

### Link Campaign Scripts Usage

```bash
# Run standard link analysis (dry run)
python3 scripts/simple_link_campaign.py

# Fix links automatically where possible
python3 scripts/simple_link_campaign.py --fix

# Fix critical documentation links
python3 scripts/fix_critical_links.py

# Run CI validation checks
./scripts/validate_links_ci.sh
```

### Custom Link Mappings Format

The `link_mappings.json` file uses a simple key-value format:

```json
{
  "broken/path.md": "correct/path.md",
  "./relative/path.md": "../correct/path.md"
}
```

## Success Metrics

We will track the following metrics to measure progress:

1. **Broken Link Count**: Currently 528, target is 0
2. **Documentation Coverage**: All code functionality documented
3. **Build Success Rate**: 100% documentation build success
4. **User Feedback**: Reduced documentation-related issues
